# Meeting 

## Project 
* Analysis of *Great Comet* musical and how it adapts *War & Peace* through looking at the musical's lyrics and Book Two of *War & Peace* 
* Research question: adaptation is the main focus. We might also focus on which characters are omitted, how are they omitted, which characters speak more because of certain omissions. 
* In the musical, characters describe themselves doing things "I'm crying now". When and why do they describe themselves and other people?
* We love musicals. 
* Operatic musical (no scenes with just speech). 
* Pretty easy to skim. 
* Musical analysis: musical starts out with traditional Russian music (until Anatole Kuragin is introduced). Anatole brings in the electronic music elements (*The Great Comet* is an Electropop musical). 
* Three aspects to the analysis: literary, stage adaptation, and sonic landscape
