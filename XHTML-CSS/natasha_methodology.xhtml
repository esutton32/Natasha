            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <h3>Book Markup</h3>
            <p>The book markup began with XML tagging through the use of regular expressions. All
                characters were tagged through regular expressions and then manually after for
                nicknames/mentions that might have been missed in the regular expressions. Each
                character was given an attribute that aligns with the musical markup. A schema was
                developed to ensure the validity of the markup, as well as group character names. As
                mentioned in the Russian Naming Conventions section in the ‘ABOUT’ tab, the
                characters in the novel are referred to by multiple names depending on who addresses
                them. The text of War and Peace was found online at “Project Gutenberg” and already
                contained markup of the text including books, book titles, chapter, chapter titles,
                paragraphs, and quotations.</p>
            <h3>Music Markup</h3>
            <p>The musical markup consisted of XML tagging of the speakers, stanzas,
                choruses/verses, characters, spoken action, and references to War and Peace through
                the use of regular expressions. A schema was developed to ensure the validity of the
                markup and group character names, similar to the book markup. The musical lyrics
                were found online at “Genius Lyrics.”</p>
            <h3>XSLT and SVG</h3>
            <p>XSLT and SVG To visualize our data, we used XSL to produce the graphs that showed the
                outcome of our research. We used SVG to upload our graphs onto our website, so as
                users could see the outcome of data collection as well. As the coding was completed
                in XSLT, we had to draw on other files such as the Book 8 file and each song from
                The Great Comet to be able to access what was originally marked up in each file.
                From there, we were able to create the data visualizations that can be seen under
                the 'ANALYSIS" tab.</p>
            <h3>The PROGRAM Tab</h3>
            <p>One of our unique struggles in our research was attempting to visually represent the
                characters' relationships to one another-- something that the book and play both do
                in concrete (but hard to quantify) ways. Our data-based visualizations on our
                analysis page certainly helped-- but such graphs are limited to communicating
                relationships numerically. An essential piece of this story is the social
                relationships. In order to visualize these, we took a page out of the play's book
                (pun intended) and created a virtual version of the playbill's graphic. With arrows
                labeled to indicate how characters are connected, this graph is able to communicate
                what our more empirical ones could not, and lets our user base familiarize
                themselves with the text in an interactive and research-friendly manner.</p>
