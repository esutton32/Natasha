            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <h3>Book Markup</h3>
            <p>The book markup began with XML tagging through the use of regular expressions. All
                characters were tagged through regular expressions and then manually after for
                nicknames/mentions that might have been missed in the regular expressions. Each
                character was given an attribute that aligns with the musical markup. A schema was
                developed to ensure the validity of the markup, as well as group character names. As
                mentioned in the Russian Naming Conventions section in the ‘ABOUT’ tab, the
                characters in the novel are referred to by multiple names depending on who addresses
                them. The text of War and Peace was found online at “Project Gutenberg” and already
                contained markup of the text including books, book titles, chapter, chapter titles,
                paragraphs, and quotations.</p>
            <h3>Music Markup</h3>
            <p>The musical markup consisted of XML tagging of the speakers, stanzas,
                choruses/verses, characters, spoken action, and references to War and Peace through
                the use of regular expressions. A schema was developed to ensure the validity of the
                markup and group character names, similar to the book markup. The musical lyrics
                were found online at “Genius Lyrics.”</p>
