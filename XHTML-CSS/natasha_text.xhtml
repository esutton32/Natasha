                    <p class="flex-para">Pierre without any apparent cause suddenly felt it
                        impossible to go on living as before.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Only the skeleton of life remained: his house, a brilliant
                        wife who now enjoyed the favors of a very important personage, acquaintance
                        with all Petersburg, and his court service with its dull formalities.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">And this life suddenly seemed to Pierre unexpectedly
                        loathsome.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">In Moscow as soon as he entered his huge house in which the
                        faded and fading princesses still lived, with its enormous retinue; as soon
                        as, driving through the town, he saw the Iberian shrine with innumerable
                        tapers burning before the golden covers of the icons, the Krémlin Square
                        with its snow undisturbed by vehicles, the sleigh drivers and hovels of the
                        Sívtsev Vrazhók, those old Moscovites who desired nothing, hurried nowhere,
                        and were ending their days leisurely; when he saw those old Moscow ladies,
                        the Moscow balls, and the English Club, he felt himself at home in a quiet
                        haven.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Moscow society, from the old women down to the children,
                        received Pierre like a long-expected guest whose place was always ready
                        awaiting him. For Moscow society Pierre was the nicest, kindest, most
                        intellectual, merriest, and most magnanimous of cranks, a heedless, genial
                        nobleman of the old Russian type. His purse was always empty because it was
                        open to everyone.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Il est charmant; il n’a pas de sexe,</q> they said of
                        him. <q>He is charming; he has no sex.</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Pierre was one of those retired gentlemen-in-waiting of
                        whom there were hundreds good-humoredly ending their days in Moscow.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Sometimes he consoled himself with the thought that he was
                        only living this life temporarily; but then he was shocked by the thought of
                        how many, like himself, had entered that life and that club temporarily,
                        with all their teeth and hair, and had only left it when not a single tooth
                        or hair remained.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">In moments of pride, when he thought of his position it
                        seemed to him that he was quite different and distinct from those other
                        retired gentlemen-in-waiting he had formerly despised: they were empty,
                        stupid, contented fellows, satisfied with their position, <q>while I am
                            still discontented and want to do something for mankind. But perhaps all
                            these comrades of mine struggled just like me and sought something new,
                            a path in life of their own, and like me were brought by force of
                            circumstances, society, and race—by that elemental force against which
                            man is powerless—to the condition I am in,</q> said he to himself in
                        moments of humility; and after living some time in Moscow he no longer
                        despised, but began to grow fond of, to respect, and to pity his comrades in
                        destiny, as he pitied himself.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">So thought Pierre, and the whole of this general deception
                        which everyone accepts, accustomed as he was to it, astonished him each time
                        as if it were something new. <q>I understand the deception and
                            confusion,</q> he thought, <q>but how am I to tell them all that I see?
                            I have tried, and have always found that they too in the depths of their
                            souls understand it as I do, and only try not to see it. So it appears
                            that it must be so! But I—what is to become of me?</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Though the doctors warned him that with his corpulence wine
                        was dangerous for him, he drank a great deal. He was only quite at ease when
                        having poured several glasses of wine mechanically into his large mouth he
                        felt a pleasant warmth in his body, an amiability toward all his fellows,
                        and a readiness to respond superficially to every idea without probing it
                        deeply</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>It doesn’t matter. I’ll get it unraveled. I have a
                            solution ready, but have no time now—I’ll think it all out later on!</q>
                        But the later on never came.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Nothing is trivial, and nothing is important, it’s all
                            the same—only to save oneself from it as best one can,</q> thought
                        Pierre. <q>Only not to see it, that dreadful it!</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para">The prince had aged very much that year. He showed marked
                        signs of senility by a tendency to fall asleep, forgetfulness of quite
                        recent events, remembrance of remote ones, and the childish vanity with
                        which he accepted the role of head of the Moscow opposition. In spite of
                        this the old man inspired in all his visitors alike a feeling of respectful
                        veneration—especially of an evening when he came in to tea in his
                        old-fashioned coat and powdered wig and, aroused by anyone, told his abrupt
                        stories of the past, or uttered yet more abrupt and scathing criticisms of
                        the present. For them all, that old-fashioned house with its gigantic
                        mirrors, pre-Revolution furniture, powdered footmen, and the stern shrewd
                        old man (himself a relic of the past century) with his gentle daughter and
                        the pretty Frenchwoman who were reverently devoted to him presented a
                        majestic and agreeable spectacle.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">But the visitors did not reflect that besides the couple of
                        hours during which they saw their host, there were also twenty-two hours in
                        the day during which the private and intimate life of the house
                        continued.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">She did not go out into society; everyone knew that her
                        father would not let her go anywhere without him, and his failing health
                        prevented his going out himself, so that she was not invited to dinners and
                        evening parties. She had quite abandoned the hope of getting married.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">She saw the coldness and malevolence with which the old
                        prince received and dismissed the young men, possible suitors, who sometimes
                        appeared at their house. She had no friends</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">The idea that at the first moment of receiving the news of
                        his son’s intentions had occurred to him in jest—that if Andrew got married
                        he himself would marry Bourienne—had evidently pleased him</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">One day in Moscow in Princess Mary’s presence (she thought
                        her father did it purposely when she was there) the old prince kissed
                        Mademoiselle Bourienne’s hand and, drawing her to him, embraced her
                        affectionately. Princess Mary flushed and ran out of the room.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">
                        <q>It’s horrible, vile, inhuman, to take advantage of the weakness...</q>
                    </p>
                    <p class="flex-para">At such moments something like a pride of sacrifice
                        gathered in her soul. And suddenly that father whom she had judged would
                        look for his spectacles in her presence, fumbling near them and not seeing
                        them, or would forget something that had just occurred, or take a false step
                        with his failing legs and turn to see if anyone had noticed his feebleness,
                        or, worst of all, at dinner when there were no visitors to excite him would
                        suddenly fall asleep, letting his napkin drop and his shaking head sink over
                        his plate. <q>He is old and feeble, and I dare to condemn him!</q> she
                        thought at such moments, with a feeling of revulsion against herself.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Then she had dinner, a substantial and appetizing meal at
                        which there were always three or four guests; after dinner she played a game
                        of boston, and at night she had the newspapers or a new book read to her
                        while she knitted.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>The count’s things? Bring them here,</q> she said,
                        pointing to the portmanteaus and not greeting anyone. <q>The young ladies’?
                            There to the left. Now what are you dawdling for?</q> she cried to the
                        maids. <q>Get the samovar ready!... You’ve grown plumper and prettier,</q>
                        she remarked, drawing Natásha (whose cheeks were glowing from the cold) to
                        her by the hood. <q>Foo! You are cold! Now take off your things, quick!</q>
                        she shouted to the count who was going to kiss her hand. <q>You’re half
                            frozen, I’m sure! Bring some rum for tea!... Bonjour, Sónya dear!</q>
                        she added, turning to Sónya and indicating by this French greeting her
                        slightly contemptuous though affectionate attitude toward her.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>All right. All right. They’ll be safe with me, as safe
                            as in Chancery! I’ll take them where they must go, scold them a bit, and
                            pet them a bit,</q> said Márya Dmítrievna, touching her goddaughter and
                        favorite, Natásha, on the cheek with her large hand.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Well, now we’ll talk. I congratulate you on your
                            betrothed. You’ve hooked a fine fellow! I am glad for your sake and I’ve
                            known him since he was so high.</q> She held her hand a couple of feet
                        from the ground. Natásha blushed happily. <q>I like him and all his family.
                            Now listen! You know that old Prince Nicholas much dislikes his son’s
                            marrying. The old fellow’s crotchety! Of course Prince Andrew is not a
                            child and can shift without him, but it’s not nice to enter a family
                            against a father’s will. One wants to do it peacefully and lovingly.
                            You’re a clever girl and you’ll know how to manage. Be kind, and use
                            your wits. Then all will be well.</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Natásha remained silent, from shyness Márya Dmítrievna
                        supposed, but really because she disliked anyone interfering in what touched
                        her love of Prince Andrew, which seemed to her so apart from all human
                        affairs that no one could understand it. She loved and knew Prince Andrew,
                        he loved her only, and was to come one of these days and take her. She
                        wanted nothing more.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>They can’t help liking me,</q> she thought. <q>Everybody
                            always has liked me, and I am so willing to do anything they wish, so
                            ready to be fond of him—for being his father—and of her—for being his
                            sister—that there is no reason for them not to like me....</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para">From the first glance Princess Mary did not like Natásha.
                        She thought her too fashionably dressed, frivolously gay and vain. She did
                        not at all realize that before having seen her future sister-in-law she was
                        prejudiced against her by involuntary envy of her beauty, youth, and
                        happiness, as well as by jealousy of her brother’s love for her.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Apart from this insuperable antipathy to her, Princess Mary
                        was agitated just then because on the Rostóvs’ being announced, the old
                        prince had shouted that he did not wish to see them, that Princess Mary
                        might do so if she chose, but they were not to be admitted to him. She had
                        decided to receive them, but feared lest the prince might at any moment
                        indulge in some freak, as he seemed much upset by the Rostóvs’ visit.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>I am so glad you should get to know one another... very
                            sorry the prince is still ailing,</q> and after a few more commonplace
                        remarks he rose.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">She blushed for him, grew still angrier at having blushed,
                        and looked at the princess with a bold and defiant expression which said
                        that she was not afraid of anybody.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Natásha felt offended by the hesitation she had noticed in
                        the anteroom, by her father’s nervousness, and by the unnatural manner of
                        the princess who—she thought—was making a favor of receiving her, and so
                        everything displeased her. She did not like Princess Mary, whom she thought
                        very plain, affected, and dry.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Natásha suddenly shrank into herself and involuntarily
                        assumed an offhand air which alienated Princess Mary still more. After five
                        minutes of irksome, constrained conversation, they heard the sound of
                        slippered feet rapidly approaching.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>I beg you to excuse me, excuse me! God is my witness, I
                            did not know,</q> muttered the old man, and after looking Natásha over
                        from head to foot he went out.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Dear Natalie,</q> said Princess Mary, <q>I want you to
                            know that I am glad my brother has found happiness....</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>I think, Princess, it is not convenient to speak of that
                            now,</q> she said with external dignity and coldness, though she felt
                        the tears choking her. <q>What have I said and what have I done?</q> thought
                        she, as soon as she was out of the room.They waited a long time for Natásha
                        to come to dinner that day. She sat in her room crying like a child, blowing
                        her nose and sobbing. Sónya stood beside her, kissing her hair. <q> Natásha,
                            what is it about?</q> she asked. <q>What do they matter to you? It will
                            all pass, Natásha.</q>
                        <q>But if you only knew how offensive it was... as if I...</q>
                        <q>Don’t talk about it, Natásha. It wasn’t your fault so why should you
                            mind? Kiss me,</q> said Sónya.Natásha raised her head and, kissing her
                        friend on the lips, pressed her wet face against her. <q>I can’t tell you, I
                            don’t know. No one’s to blame,</q> said Natásha—<q>It’s my fault. But it
                            all hurts terribly. Oh, why doesn’t he come?...</q>
                    </p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>O God, if he were here now I would not behave as I did
                            then, but differently. I would not be silly and afraid of things, I
                            would simply embrace him, cling to him, and make him look at me with
                            those searching inquiring eyes with which he has so often looked at me,
                            and then I would make him laugh as he used to laugh. And his eyes—how I
                            see those eyes!</q> thought Natásha. <q>And what do his father and
                            sister matter to me? I love him alone, him, him, with that face and
                            those eyes, with his smile, manly and yet childlike....</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para">
                        <q>I can’t bear this waiting and I shall cry in a minute!</q>
                    </p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Natásha at that moment felt so softened and tender that it
                        was not enough for her to love and know she was beloved, she wanted now, at
                        once, to embrace the man she loved, to speak and hear from him words of love
                        such as filled her heart.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">The music sounded louder and through the door rows of
                        brightly lit boxes in which ladies sat with bare arms and shoulders, and
                        noisy stalls brilliant with uniforms, glittered before their eyes. A lady
                        entering the next box shot a glance of feminine envy at Natásha. The curtain
                        had not yet risen and the overture was being played. Natásha, smoothing her
                        gown, went in with Sónya and sat down, scanning the brilliant tiers of boxes
                        opposite. A sensation she had not experienced for a long time—that of
                        hundreds of eyes looking at her bare arms and neck—suddenly affected her
                        both agreeably and disagreeably and called up a whole crowd of memories,
                        desires and emotions associated with that feeling.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">The two remarkably pretty girls, Natásha and Sónya, with
                        Count Rostóv who had not been seen in Moscow for a long time, attracted
                        general attention. Moreover, everybody knew vaguely of Natásha’s engagement
                        to Prince Andrew, and knew that the Rostóvs had lived in the country ever
                        since, and all looked with curiosity at a fiancée who was making one of the
                        best matches in Russia.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Dear me, Michael Kirílovich has grown still stouter!</q>
                        remarked the count. <q>Look at our Anna Mikháylovna—what a headdress she has
                            on!</q><q>The Karágins, Julie—and Borís with them. One can see at once
                            that they’re engaged....</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>They are talking about us, about me and him!</q> thought
                        Natásha. <q>And he no doubt is calming her jealousy of me. They needn’t
                            trouble themselves! If only they knew how little I am concerned about
                            any of them.</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para">He stood in full view of the audience, well aware that he
                        was attracting everyone’s attention, yet as much at ease as though he were
                        in his own room. Around him thronged Moscow’s most brilliant young men, whom
                        he evidently dominated.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>He did,</q> replied Shinshín. <q>He was in the Caucasus
                            and ran away from there. They say he has been acting as minister to some
                            ruling prince in Persia, where he killed the Shah’s brother. Now all the
                            Moscow ladies are mad about him! It’s Dólokhov the Persian that does
                            it!</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para">A tall, beautiful woman with a mass of plaited hair and
                        much exposed plump white shoulders and neck, round which she wore a double
                        string of large pearls, entered the adjoining box rustling her heavy silk
                        dress and took a long time settling into her place.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Natásha involuntarily gazed at that neck, those shoulders,
                        and pearls and coiffure, and admired the beauty of the shoulders and the
                        pearls. While Natásha was fixing her gaze on her for the second time the
                        lady looked round and, meeting the count’s eyes, nodded to him and smiled.
                        She was the Countess Bezúkhova, Pierre’s wife, and the count, who knew
                        everyone in society, leaned over and spoke to her.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Have you been here long, Countess?</q> he inquired.
                            <q>I’ll call, I’ll call to kiss your hand. I’m here on business and have
                            brought my girls with me. They say Semënova acts marvelously. Count
                            Pierre never used to forget us. Is he here?</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para">As soon as it rose everyone in the boxes and stalls became
                        silent, and all the men, old and young, in uniform and evening dress, and
                        all the women with gems on their bare flesh, turned their whole attention
                        with eager curiosity to the stage.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">After her life in the country, and in her present serious
                        mood, all this seemed grotesque and amazing to Natásha. She could not follow
                        the opera nor even listen to the music; she saw only the painted cardboard
                        and the queerly dressed men and women who moved, spoke, and sang so
                        strangely in that brilliant light. She knew what it was all meant to
                        represent, but it was so pretentiously false and unnatural that she first
                        felt ashamed for the actors and then amused at them. She looked at the faces
                        of the audience, seeking in them the same sense of ridicule and perplexity
                        she herself experienced, but they all seemed attentive to what was happening
                        on the stage, and expressed delight which to Natásha seemed feigned.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">especially at Hélène in the next box, who—apparently quite
                        unclothed—sat with a quiet tranquil smile</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">And feeling the bright light that flooded the whole place
                        and the warm air heated by the crowd, Natásha little by little began to pass
                        into a state of intoxication she had not experienced for a long while.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">As she looked and thought, the strangest fancies
                        unexpectedly and disconnectedly passed through her mind: the idea occurred
                        to her of jumping onto the edge of the box and singing the aria the actress
                        was singing, then she wished to touch with her fan an old gentleman sitting
                        not far from her, then to lean over to Hélène and tickle her.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">At a moment when all was quiet before the commencement of a
                        song, a door leading to the stalls on the side nearest the Rostóvs’ box
                        creaked, and the steps of a belated arrival were heard. <q>There’s
                            Kurágin!</q> whispered Shinshín. Countess Bezúkhova turned smiling to
                        the newcomer, and Natásha, following the direction of that look, saw an
                        exceptionally handsome adjutant approaching their box with a self-assured
                        yet courteous bearing. This was Anatole Kurágin whom she had seen and
                        noticed long ago at the ball in Petersburg. He was now in an adjutant’s
                        uniform with one epaulet and a shoulder knot. He moved with a restrained
                        swagger which would have been ridiculous had he not been so good-looking and
                        had his handsome face not worn such an expression of good-humored
                        complacency and gaiety. Though the performance was proceeding, he walked
                        deliberately down the carpeted gangway, his sword and spurs slightly
                        jingling and his handsome perfumed head held high. Having looked at Natásha
                        he approached his sister, laid his well gloved hand on the edge of her box,
                        nodded to her, and leaning forward asked a question, with a motion toward
                        Natásha.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Mais charmante!</q> said he, evidently referring to
                        Natásha, who did not exactly hear his words but understood them from the
                        movement of his lips. Then he took his place in the first row of the stalls
                        and sat down beside Dólokhov, nudging with his elbow in a friendly and
                        offhand way that Dólokhov whom others treated so fawningly. He winked at him
                        gaily, smiled, and rested his foot against the orchestra screen.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">She turned and their eyes met. Almost smiling, he gazed
                        straight into her eyes with such an enraptured caressing look that it seemed
                        strange to be so near him, to look at him like that, to be so sure he
                        admired her, and not to be acquainted with him.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">In the second act there was scenery representing
                        tombstones, there was a round hole in the canvas to represent the moon,
                        shades were raised over the footlights, and from horns and contrabass came
                        deep notes while many people appeared from right and left wearing black
                        cloaks and holding things like daggers in their hands. They began waving
                        their arms.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">
                        <q>How is it you’re not ashamed to bury such pearls in the country?</q>
                    </p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Countess Bezúkhova quite deserved her reputation of being a
                        fascinating woman. She could say what she did not think—especially what was
                        flattering—quite simply and naturally.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">The scene of the third act represented a palace in which
                        many candles were burning and pictures of knights with short beards hung on
                        the walls. In the middle stood what were probably a king and a queen. The
                        king waved his right arm and, evidently nervous, sang something badly and
                        sat down on a crimson throne.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">But suddenly a storm came on, chromatic scales and
                        diminished sevenths were heard in the orchestra, everyone ran off, again
                        dragging one of their number away, and the curtain dropped. Once more there
                        was a terrible noise and clatter among the audience, and with rapturous
                        faces everyone began shouting: <q>Duport! Duport! Duport!</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para">During the entr’acte a whiff of cold air came into Hélène’s
                        box, the door opened, and Anatole entered, stooping and trying not to brush
                        against anyone.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Anatole, who was as handsome at close quarters as at a
                        distance, sat down beside her and told her he had long wished to have this
                        happiness—ever since the Narýshkins’ ball in fact, at which he had had the
                        well-remembered pleasure of seeing her. Kurágin was much more sensible and
                        simple with women than among men. He talked boldly and naturally, and
                        Natásha was strangely and agreeably struck by the fact that there was
                        nothing formidable in this man about whom there was so much talk, but that
                        on the contrary his smile was most naïve, cheerful, and good-natured.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Kurágin asked her opinion of the performance and told her
                        how at a previous performance Semënova had fallen down on the stage.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>And do you know, Countess,</q> he said, suddenly
                        addressing her as an old, familiar acquaintance, <q>we are getting up a
                            costume tournament; you ought to take part in it! It will be great fun.
                            We shall all meet at the Karágins’! Please come! No! Really, eh?</q>
                        said he.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">While saying this he never removed his smiling eyes from
                        her face, her neck, and her bare arms. Natásha knew for certain that he was
                        enraptured by her. This pleased her, yet his presence made her feel
                        constrained and oppressed. When she was not looking at him she felt that he
                        was looking at her shoulders, and she involuntarily caught his eye so that
                        he should look into hers rather than this. But looking into his eyes she was
                        frightened, realizing that there was not that barrier of modesty she had
                        always felt between herself and other men. She did not know how it was that
                        within five minutes she had come to feel herself terribly near to this man.
                        When she turned away she feared he might seize her from behind by her bare
                        arm and kiss her on the neck. They spoke of most ordinary things, yet she
                        felt that they were closer to one another than she had ever been to any
                        man.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">During one of these moments of awkward silence when
                        Anatole’s prominent eyes were gazing calmly and fixedly at her, Natásha, to
                        break the silence, asked him how he liked Moscow.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>At first I did not like it much, because what makes a
                            town pleasant ce sont les jolies femmes, * isn’t that so? But now I like
                            it very much indeed,</q> he said, looking at her significantly.
                            <q>You’ll come to the costume tournament, Countess? Do come!</q> and
                        putting out his hand to her bouquet and dropping his voice, he added, <q>You
                            will be the prettiest there. Do come, dear countess, and give me this
                            flower as a pledge!</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para">She smiled just as he was doing, gazing straight into his
                        eyes. And again she felt with horror that no barrier lay between him and
                        her.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">There was a special reason for this, as he had got married
                        two years before—a fact known only to his most intimate friends. At that
                        time while with his regiment in Poland, a Polish landowner of small means
                        had forced him to marry his daughter.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Anatole was always content with his position, with himself,
                        and with others. He was instinctively and thoroughly convinced that it was
                        impossible for him to live otherwise than as he did and that he had never in
                        his life done anything base. He was incapable of considering how his actions
                        might affect others or what the consequences of this or that action of his
                        might be. He was convinced that, as a duck is so made that it must live in
                        water, so God had made him such that he must spend thirty thousand rubles a
                        year and always occupy a prominent position in society.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">All he cared about was gaiety and women, and as according
                        to his ideas there was nothing dishonorable in these tastes, and he was
                        incapable of considering what the gratification of his tastes entailed for
                        others, he honestly considered himself irreproachable, sincerely despised
                        rogues and bad people, and with a tranquil conscience carried his head
                        high.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">At supper after the opera he described to Dólokhov with the
                        air of a connoisseur the attractions of her arms, shoulders, feet, and hair
                        and expressed his intention of making love to her.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>She’s first-rate, my dear fellow, but not for us,</q>
                        replied Dólokhov. <q>I will tell my sister to ask her to dinner,</q> said
                        Anatole. <q>Eh?</q>
                        <q>You’d better wait till she’s married....</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>You know, I adore little girls, they lose their heads at
                            once,</q> pursued Anatole.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">She suffered more now than during her first days in Moscow.
                        To her impatience and pining for him were now added the unpleasant
                        recollection of her interview with Princess Mary and the old prince, and a
                        fear and anxiety of which she did not understand the cause. She continually
                        fancied that either he would never come or that something would happen to
                        her before he came.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">As soon as she began to think of him, the recollection of
                        the old prince, of Princess Mary, of the theater, and of Kurágin mingled
                        with her thoughts. The question again presented itself whether she was not
                        guilty, whether she had not already broken faith with Prince Andrew, and
                        again she found herself recalling to the minutest detail every word, every
                        gesture, and every shade in the play of expression on the face of the man
                        who had been able to arouse in her such an incomprehensible and terrifying
                        feeling.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">She wore her holiday shawl, in which she paid calls, and
                        announced that she was going to see Prince Nicholas Bolkónski to have an
                        explanation with him about Natásha.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">After she had gone, a dressmaker from Madame Suppert-Roguet
                        waited on the Rostóvs, and Natásha, very glad of this diversion, having shut
                        herself into a room adjoining the drawing room, occupied herself trying on
                        the new dresses.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Just as she had put on a bodice without sleeves and only
                        tacked together, and was turning her head to see in the glass how the back
                        fitted, she heard in the drawing room the animated sounds of her father’s
                        voice and another’s—a woman’s—that made her flush.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Oh, my enchantress!</q> she cried to the blushing
                        Natásha. <q>Charming! No, this is really beyond anything, my dear count,</q>
                        said she to Count Rostóv who had followed her in. <q>How can you live in
                            Moscow and go nowhere?</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para">She looked at Natásha’s dresses and praised them, as well
                        as a new dress of her own made of <q>metallic gauze,</q> which she had
                        received from Paris, and advised Natásha to have one like it.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>But anything suits you, my charmer!</q> she
                        remarked.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">The idea of throwing her brother and Natásha together
                        amused her.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">
                        <q>My brother dined with me yesterday—we nearly died of laughter—he ate
                            nothing and kept sighing for you, my charmer! He is madly, quite madly,
                            in love with you, my dear.</q>
                    </p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>How she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!</q> said
                        Hélène. <q>You must certainly come. If you love somebody, my charmer, that
                            is not a reason to shut yourself up. Even if you are engaged, I am sure
                            your fiancé would wish you to go into society rather than be bored to
                            death.</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>So she knows I am engaged, and she and her husband
                            Pierre—that good Pierre—have talked and laughed about this. So it’s all
                            right.</q> And again, under Hélène’s influence, what had seemed terrible
                        now seemed simple and natural. <q>And she is such a grande dame, so kind,
                            and evidently likes me so much. And why not enjoy myself?</q> thought
                        Natásha, gazing at Hélène with wide-open, wondering eyes.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Anatole was at the door, evidently on the lookout for the
                        Rostóvs.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">As soon as she saw him she was seized by the same feeling
                        she had had at the opera—gratified vanity at his admiration of her and fear
                        at the absence of a moral barrier between them.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Adorable! divine! delicious!</q> was heard from every
                        side. Natásha looked at the fat actress, but neither saw nor heard nor
                        understood anything of what went on before her. She only felt herself again
                        completely borne away into this strange senseless world—so remote from her
                        old world—a world in which it was impossible to know what was good or bad,
                        reasonable or senseless. Behind her sat Anatole, and conscious of his
                        proximity she experienced a frightened sense of expectancy.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">He said this at a moment when she alone could hear him.
                            <q>You are enchanting... from the moment I saw you I have never
                            ceased...</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Anatole asked Natásha for a valse and as they danced he
                        pressed her waist and hand and told her she was bewitching and that he loved
                        her. During the écossaise, which she also danced with him, Anatole said
                        nothing when they happened to be by themselves, but merely gazed at her.
                        Natásha lifted her frightened eyes to him, but there was such confident
                        tenderness in his affectionate look and smile that she could not, whilst
                        looking at him, say what she had to say. She lowered her eyes.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Don’t say such things to me. I am betrothed and love
                            another,</q> she said rapidly.... She glanced at him.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Don’t speak to me of that! What can I do?</q> said he.
                            <q>I tell you I am madly, madly, in love with you! Is it my fault that
                            you are enchanting?... It’s our turn to begin.</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Natásha, animated and excited, looked about her with
                        wide-open frightened eyes and seemed merrier than usual. She understood
                        hardly anything that went on that evening. They danced the écossaise and the
                        Grossvater.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>I cannot come to visit you but is it possible that I
                            shall never see you? I love you madly. Can I never...?</q> and, blocking
                        her path, he brought his face close to hers. His large, glittering,
                        masculine eyes were so close to hers that she saw nothing but them.<q>
                            Natalie?</q> he whispered inquiringly while she felt her hands being
                        painfully pressed. <q>Natalie?</q>
                        <q>I don’t understand. I have nothing to say,</q> her eyes replied.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Burning lips were pressed to hers, and at the same instant
                        she felt herself released, and Hélène’s footsteps and the rustle of her
                        dress were heard in the room. Natásha looked round at her, and then, red and
                        trembling, threw a frightened look of inquiry at Anatole and moved toward
                        the door.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">She paused. She so wanted a word from him that would
                        explain to her what had happened and to which she could find no answer.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">After reaching home Natásha did not sleep all night. She
                        was tormented by the insoluble question whether she loved Anatole or Prince
                        Andrew. She loved Prince Andrew—she remembered distinctly how deeply she
                        loved him. But she also loved Anatole, of that there was no doubt. <q>Else
                            how could all this have happened?</q> thought she. <q>If, after that, I
                            could return his smile when saying good-by, if I was able to let it come
                            to that, it means that I loved him from the first. It means that he is
                            kind, noble, and splendid, and I could not help loving him.</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>What am I to do if I love him and the other one too?</q>
                        she asked herself, unable to find an answer to these terrible questions.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Princess Mary wrote that she was in despair at the
                        misunderstanding that had occurred between them. Whatever her father’s
                        feelings might be, she begged Natásha to believe that she could not help
                        loving her as the one chosen by her brother, for whose happiness she was
                        ready to sacrifice everything.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Do not think, however,</q> she wrote, <q>that my father
                            is ill-disposed toward you. He is an invalid and an old man who must be
                            forgiven; but he is good and magnanimous and will love her who makes his
                            son happy.</q> Princess Mary went on to ask Natásha to fix a time when
                        she could see her again.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Dear Princess,</q> she wrote in French quickly and
                        mechanically, and then paused. What more could she write after all that had
                        happened the evening before? <q>Yes, yes! All that has happened, and now all
                            is changed,</q> she thought as she sat with the letter she had begun
                        before her. <q>Must I break off with him? Must I really? That’s awful...</q>
                        and to escape from these dreadful thoughts she went to Sónya and began
                        sorting patterns with her.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Only, for Christ’s sake...</q> the girl went on, as
                        Natásha, without thinking, mechanically broke the seal and read a love
                        letter from Anatole, of which, without taking in a word, she understood only
                        that it was a letter from him—from the man she loved. Yes, she loved him, or
                        else how could that have happened which had happened? And how could she have
                        a love letter from him in her hand?</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">With trembling hands Natásha held that passionate love
                        letter which Dólokhov had composed for Anatole</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Since yesterday evening my fate has been sealed; to be
                            loved by you or to die. There is no other way for me,</q> the letter
                        began. Then he went on to say that he knew her parents would not give her to
                        him—for this there were secret reasons he could reveal only to her—but that
                        if she loved him she need only say the word yes, and no human power could
                        hinder their bliss. Love would conquer all. He would steal her away and
                        carry her off to the ends of the earth.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Yes, yes! I love him!</q> thought Natásha, reading the
                        letter for the twentieth time and finding some peculiarly deep meaning in
                        each word of it.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>How was it I noticed nothing? How could it go so far?
                            Can she have left off loving Prince Andrew? And how could she let
                            Kurágin go to such lengths? He is a deceiver and a villain, that’s
                            plain! What will Nicholas, dear noble Nicholas, do when he hears of it?
                            So this is the meaning of her excited, resolute, unnatural look the day
                            before yesterday, yesterday, and today,</q> thought Sónya. <q>But it
                            can’t be that she loves him! She probably opened the letter without
                            knowing who it was from. Probably she is offended by it. She could not
                            do such a thing!</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Natásha!</q> she said, just audibly. Natásha awoke and
                        saw Sónya. <q>Ah, you’re back?</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para">And with the decision and tenderness that often come at the
                        moment of awakening, she embraced her friend, but noticing Sónya’s look of
                        embarrassment, her own face expressed confusion and suspicion.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">
                        <q>Sónya, you’ve read that letter?</q> she demanded. <q>Yes,</q> answered
                        Sónya softly. Natásha smiled rapturously. <q>No, Sónya, I can’t any
                            longer!</q> she said. <q>I can’t hide it from you any longer. You know,
                            we love one another! Sónya, darling, he writes... Sónya...</q> Sónya
                        stared open-eyed at Natásha, unable to believe her ears. <q>And
                            Bolkónski?</q> she asked. <q>Ah, Sónya, if you only knew how happy I
                            am!</q> cried Natásha. <q>You don’t know what love is....</q>
                        <q>But, Natásha, can that be all over?</q> Natásha looked at Sónya with
                        wide-open eyes as if she could not grasp the question. <q>Well, then, are
                            you refusing Prince Andrew?</q> said Sónya. <q>Oh, you don’t understand
                            anything! Don’t talk nonsense, just listen!</q> said Natásha, with
                        momentary vexation. <q>But I can’t believe it,</q> insisted Sónya. <q>I
                            don’t understand. How is it you have loved a man for a whole year and
                            suddenly... Why, you have only seen him three times! Natásha, I don’t
                            believe you, you’re joking! In three days to forget everything and
                            so...</q>
                        <q>Three days?</q> said Natásha. <q>It seems to me I’ve loved him a hundred
                            years. It seems to me that I have never loved anyone before. You can’t
                            understand it.... Sónya, wait a bit, sit here,</q> and Natásha embraced
                        and kissed her. <q>I had heard that it happens like this, and you must have
                            heard it too, but it’s only now that I feel such love. It’s not the same
                            as before. As soon as I saw him I felt he was my master and I his slave,
                            and that I could not help loving him. Yes, his slave! Whatever he orders
                            I shall do. You don’t understand that. What can I do? What can I do,
                            Sónya?</q> cried Natásha with a happy yet frightened expression. <q>But
                            think what you are doing,</q> cried Sónya. <q>I can’t leave it like
                            this. This secret correspondence... How could you let him go so far?</q>
                        she went on, with a horror and disgust she could hardly conceal. <q>I told
                            you that I have no will,</q> Natásha replied. <q>Why can’t you
                            understand? I love him!</q>
                        <q>Then I won’t let it come to that... I shall tell!</q> cried Sónya,
                        bursting into tears. <q>What do you mean? For God’s sake... If you tell, you
                            are my enemy!</q> declared Natásha. <q>You want me to be miserable, you
                            want us to be separated....</q> When she saw Natásha’s fright, Sónya
                        shed tears of shame and pity for her friend. <q>But what has happened
                            between you?</q> she asked. <q>What has he said to you? Why doesn’t he
                            come to the house?</q> Natásha did not answer her questions. <q>For
                            God’s sake, Sónya, don’t tell anyone, don’t torture me,</q> Natásha
                        entreated. <q>Remember no one ought to interfere in such matters! I have
                            confided in you....</q>
                        <q>But why this secrecy? Why doesn’t he come to the house?</q> asked Sónya.
                            <q>Why doesn’t he openly ask for your hand? You know Prince Andrew gave
                            you complete freedom—if it is really so; but I don’t believe it!
                            Natásha, have you considered what these secret reasons can be?</q>
                        Natásha looked at Sónya with astonishment. Evidently this question presented
                        itself to her mind for the first time and she did not know how to answer it.
                            <q>I don’t know what the reasons are. But there must be reasons!</q>
                        Sónya sighed and shook her head incredulously. <q>If there were
                            reasons...</q> she began. But Natásha, guessing her doubts, interrupted
                        her in alarm. <q>Sónya, one can’t doubt him! One can’t, one can’t! Don’t you
                            understand?</q> she cried. <q>Does he love you?</q>
                        <q>Does he love me?</q> Natásha repeated with a smile of pity at her
                        friend’s lack of comprehension. <q>Why, you have read his letter and you
                            have seen him.</q>
                        <q>But if he is dishonorable?</q>
                        <q>He! dishonorable? If you only knew!</q> exclaimed Natásha. <q>If he is an
                            honorable man he should either declare his intentions or cease seeing
                            you; and if you won’t do this, I will. I will write to him, and I will
                            tell Papa!</q> said Sónya resolutely. <q>But I can’t live without
                            him!</q> cried Natásha. <q>Natásha, I don’t understand you. And what are
                            you saying! Think of your father and of Nicholas.</q>
                        <q>I don’t want anyone, I don’t love anyone but him. How dare you say he is
                            dishonorable? Don’t you know that I love him?</q> screamed Natásha.
                            <q>Go away, Sónya! I don’t want to quarrel with you, but go, for God’s
                            sake go! You see how I am suffering!</q> Natásha cried angrily, in a
                        voice of despair and repressed irritation. Sónya burst into sobs and ran
                        from the room. </p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Natásha went to the table and without a moment’s reflection
                        wrote that answer to Princess Mary which she had been unable to write all
                        the morning. In this letter she said briefly that all their
                        misunderstandings were at an end; that availing herself of the magnanimity
                        of Prince Andrew who when he went abroad had given her her freedom, she
                        begged Princess Mary to forget everything and forgive her if she had been to
                        blame toward her, but that she could not be his wife. At that moment this
                        all seemed quite easy, simple, and clear to Natásha.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Oh, Sónya, if you knew him as I do! He said... He asked
                            me what I had promised Bolkónski. He was glad I was free to refuse
                            him.</q> Sónya sighed sorrowfully. <q>But you haven’t refused
                            Bolkónski?</q> said she. <q>Perhaps I have. Perhaps all is over between
                            me and Bolkónski. Why do you think so badly of me?</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Sónya did not succumb to the tender tone Natásha used
                        toward her. The more emotional and ingratiating the expression of Natásha’s
                        face became, the more serious and stern grew Sónya’s.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Natásha, I am afraid for you!</q>
                        <q>Afraid of what?</q>
                        <q>I am afraid you’re going to your ruin,</q> said Sónya resolutely, and was
                        herself horrified at what she had said. Anger again showed in Natásha’s
                        face. <q>And I’ll go to my ruin, I will, as soon as possible! It’s not your
                            business! It won’t be you, but I, who’ll suffer. Leave me alone, leave
                            me alone! I hate you!</q>
                        <q>Natásha!</q> moaned Sónya, aghast. <q>I hate you, I hate you! You’re my
                            enemy forever!</q> And Natásha ran out of the room.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Hard as it was for Sónya, she watched her friend and did
                        not let her out of her sight. The day before the count was to return, Sónya
                        noticed that Natásha sat by the drawing room window all the morning as if
                        expecting something and that she made a sign to an officer who drove past,
                        whom Sónya took to be Anatole. Sónya began watching her friend still more
                        attentively and noticed that at dinner and all that evening Natásha was in a
                        strange and unnatural state. She answered questions at random, began
                        sentences she did not finish, and laughed at everything.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">After tea Sónya noticed a housemaid at Natásha’s door
                        timidly waiting to let her pass. She let the girl go in, and then listening
                        at the door learned that another letter had been delivered. Then suddenly it
                        became clear to Sónya that Natásha had some dreadful plan for that evening.
                        Sónya knocked at her door. Natásha did not let her in.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>She will run away with him!</q> thought Sónya. <q>She is
                            capable of anything. There was something particularly pathetic and
                            resolute in her face today. She cried as she said good-by to Uncle,</q>
                        Sónya remembered. <q>Yes, that’s it, she means to elope with him, but what
                            am I to do?</q> thought she, recalling all the signs that clearly
                        indicated that Natásha had some terrible intention. <q>The count is away.
                            What am I to do? Write to Kurágin demanding an explanation? But what is
                            there to oblige him to reply? Write to Pierre, as Prince Andrew asked me
                            to in case of some misfortune?... But perhaps she really has already
                            refused Bolkónski—she sent a letter to Princess Mary yesterday. And
                            Uncle is away....</q> To tell Márya Dmítrievna who had such faith in
                        Natásha seemed to Sónya terrible. <q>Well, anyway,</q> thought Sónya as she
                        stood in the dark passage, <q>now or never I must prove that I remember the
                            family’s goodness to me and that I love Nicholas. Yes! If I don’t sleep
                            for three nights I’ll not leave this passage and will hold her back by
                            force and will and not let the family be disgraced,</q> thought she.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">The plan for Natalie Rostóva’s abduction had been arranged
                        and the preparations made by Dólokhov a few days before, and on the day that
                        Sónya, after listening at Natásha’s door, resolved to safeguard her, it was
                        to have been put into execution. Natásha had promised to come out to Kurágin
                        at the back porch at ten that evening. Kurágin was to put her into a troyka
                        he would have ready and to drive her forty miles to the village of Kámenka,
                        where an unfrocked priest was in readiness to perform a marriage ceremony
                        over them. At Kámenka a relay of horses was to wait which would take them to
                        the Warsaw highroad, and from there they would hasten abroad with post
                        horses.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Anatole had a passport, an order for post horses, ten
                        thousand rubles he had taken from his sister and another ten thousand
                        borrowed with Dólokhov’s help.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Two witnesses for the mock marriage—Khvóstikov, a retired
                        petty official whom Dólokhov made use of in his gambling transactions, and
                        Makárin, a retired hussar, a kindly, weak fellow who had an unbounded
                        affection for Kurágin—were sitting at tea in Dólokhov’s front room.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">In his large study, the walls of which were hung to the
                        ceiling with Persian rugs, bearskins, and weapons, sat Dólokhov in a
                        traveling cloak and high boots, at an open desk on which lay an abacus and
                        some bundles of paper money. Anatole, with uniform unbuttoned, walked to and
                        fro from the room where the witnesses were sitting, through the study to the
                        room behind, where his French valet and others were packing the last of his
                        things. Dólokhov was counting the money and noting something down.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Do you know? You’d really better drop it all. There’s
                            still time!</q>
                        <q>Fool,</q> retorted Anatole. <q>Don’t talk nonsense! If you only knew...
                            it’s the devil knows what!</q>
                        <q>No, really, give it up!</q> said Dólokhov. <q>I am speaking seriously.
                            It’s no joke, this plot you’ve hatched.</q>
                        <q>What, teasing again? Go to the devil! Eh?</q> said Anatole, making a
                        grimace. <q>Really it’s no time for your stupid jokes,</q> and he left the
                        room.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>You wait a bit,</q> he called after him. <q>I’m not
                            joking, I’m talking sense. Come here, come here!</q> Anatole returned
                        and looked at Dólokhov, trying to give him his attention and evidently
                        submitting to him involuntarily. <q>Now listen to me. I’m telling you this
                            for the last time. Why should I joke about it? Did I hinder you? Who
                            arranged everything for you? Who found the priest and got the passport?
                            Who raised the money? I did it all.</q>
                        <q>Well, thank you for it. Do you think I am not grateful?</q> And Anatole
                        sighed and embraced Dólokhov. <q>I helped you, but all the same I must tell
                            you the truth; it is a dangerous business, and if you think about it—a
                            stupid business. Well, you’ll carry her off—all right! Will they let it
                            stop at that? It will come out that you’re already married. Why, they’ll
                            have you in the criminal court....</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Oh, nonsense, nonsense!</q> Anatole ejaculated and again
                        made a grimace. <q>Didn’t I explain to you? What?</q> And Anatole, with the
                        partiality dull-witted people have for any conclusion they have reached by
                        their own reasoning, repeated the argument he had already put to Dólokhov a
                        hundred times. <q>Didn’t I explain to you that I have come to this
                            conclusion: if this marriage is invalid,</q> he went on, crooking one
                        finger, <q>then I have nothing to answer for; but if it is valid, no matter!
                            Abroad no one will know anything about it. Isn’t that so? And don’t talk
                            to me, don’t, don’t.</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Go to the devil!</q> cried Anatole and, clutching his
                        hair, left the room, but returned at once and dropped into an armchair in
                        front of Dólokhov with his feet turned under him. <q>It’s the very devil!
                            What? Feel how it beats!</q> He took Dólokhov’s hand and put it on his
                        heart. <q>What a foot, my dear fellow! What a glance! A goddess!</q> he
                        added in French.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Now then! Nearly ready? You’re dawdling!</q> he shouted
                        to the servants.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Anatole lay on the sofa in the study leaning on his elbow
                        and smiling pensively, while his handsome lips muttered tenderly to
                        himself.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">
                        <q>Come! Balagá is here.</q>
                    </p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Balagá was a famous troyka driver who had known Dólokhov
                        and Anatole some six years and had given them good service with his troykas.
                        More than once when Anatole’s regiment was stationed at Tver he had taken
                        him from Tver in the evening, brought him to Moscow by daybreak, and driven
                        him back again the next night. More than once he had enabled Dólokhov to
                        escape when pursued. More than once he had driven them through the town with
                        gypsies and <q>ladykins</q> as he called the cocottes. More than once in
                        their service he had run over pedestrians and upset vehicles in the streets
                        of Moscow and had always been protected from the consequences by <q>my
                            gentlemen</q> as he called them. He had ruined more than one horse in
                        their service. More than once they had beaten him, and more than once they
                        had made him drunk on champagne and Madeira, which he loved; and he knew
                        more than one thing about each of them which would long ago have sent an
                        ordinary man to Siberia. They often called Balagá into their orgies and made
                        him drink and dance at the gypsies’, and more than one thousand rubles of
                        their money had passed through his hands. In their service he risked his
                        skin and his life twenty times a year, and in their service had lost more
                        horses than the money he had from them would buy. But he liked them; liked
                        that mad driving at twelve miles an hour, liked upsetting a driver or
                        running down a pedestrian, and flying at full gallop through the Moscow
                        streets. He liked to hear those wild, tipsy shouts behind him: <q>Get on!
                            Get on!</q> when it was impossible to go any faster. He liked giving a
                        painful lash on the neck to some peasant who, more dead than alive, was
                        already hurrying out of his way. <q>Real gentlemen!</q> he considered
                        them.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>All take glasses; you too, Balagá. Well, comrades and
                            friends of my youth, we’ve had our fling and lived and reveled. Eh? And
                            now, when shall we meet again? I am going abroad. We have had a good
                            time—now farewell, lads! To our health! Hurrah!...</q> he cried, and
                        emptying his glass flung it on the floor.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>No, stop!</q> said Anatole. <q>Shut the door; we have
                            first to sit down. That’s the way.</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>And where’s the fur cloak?</q> asked Dólokhov. <q>Hey,
                            Ignátka! Go to Matrëna Matrévna and ask her for the sable cloak. I have
                            heard what elopements are like,</q> continued Dólokhov with a wink.
                            <q>Why, she’ll rush out more dead than alive just in the things she is
                            wearing; if you delay at all there’ll be tears and Papa and Mamma, and
                            she’s frozen in a minute and must go back—but you wrap the fur cloak
                            round her first thing and carry her to the sleigh.</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>That’s the way,</q> said Dólokhov</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Well, good-by, Matrëna,</q> said Anatole, kissing her.
                            <q>Ah, my revels here are over. Remember me to Stëshka. There, good-by!
                            Good-by, Matrëna, wish me luck!</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Go!</q> he cried, twisting the reins round his hands,
                        and the troyka tore down the Nikítski Boulevard.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">When they reached the gate Dólokhov whistled. The whistle
                        was answered, and a maidservant ran out. <q>Come into the courtyard or
                            you’ll be seen; she’ll come out directly,</q> said she. Dólokhov stayed
                        by the gate. Anatole followed the maid into the courtyard, turned the
                        corner, and ran up into the porch. </p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Kurágin! Come back!</q> shouted Dólokhov. <q>Betrayed!
                            Back!</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>You shameless good-for-nothing!</q> said she. <q>I won’t
                            hear a word.</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Disgusting, abominable... In my house... horrid girl,
                            hussy! I’m only sorry for her father!</q> thought she, trying to
                        restrain her wrath.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>A nice girl! Very nice!</q> said Márya Dmítrievna.
                            <q>Arranging meetings with lovers in my house! It’s no use pretending:
                            you listen when I speak to you!</q> And Márya Dmítrievna touched her
                        arm. <q>Listen when I speak! You’ve disgraced yourself like the lowest of
                            hussies. I’d treat you differently, but I’m sorry for your father, so I
                            will conceal it.</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Natásha did not change her position, but her whole body
                        heaved with noiseless, convulsive sobs which choked her.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>It’s lucky for him that he escaped me; but I’ll find
                            him!</q> she said in her rough voice. <q>Do you hear what I am saying or
                            not?</q> she added.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">She put her large hand under Natásha’s face and turned it
                        toward her.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Let me be!... What is it to me?... I shall die!</q> she
                        muttered, wrenching herself from Márya Dmítrievna’s hands with a vicious
                        effort and sinking down again into her former position.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>But when your father comes back tomorrow what am I to
                            tell him? Eh?</q> Again Natásha’s body shook with sobs. <q>Suppose he
                            finds out, and your brother, and your betrothed?</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>I have no betrothed: I have refused him!</q> cried
                        Natásha. <q>That’s all the same,</q> continued Márya Dmítrievna. <q>If they
                            hear of this, will they let it pass? He, your father, I know him... if
                            he challenges him to a duel will that be all right? Eh?</q>
                        <q>Oh, let me be! Why have you interfered at all? Why? Why? Who asked you
                            to?</q> shouted Natásha, raising herself on the sofa and looking
                        malignantly at Márya Dmítrievna.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>But what did you want?</q> cried Márya Dmítrievna,
                        growing angry again. <q>Were you kept under lock and key? Who hindered his
                            coming to the house? Why carry you off as if you were some gypsy singing
                            girl?... Well, if he had carried you off... do you think they wouldn’t
                            have found him? Your father, or brother, or your betrothed? And he’s a
                            scoundrel, a wretch—that’s a fact!</q>
                        <q>He is better than any of you!</q> exclaimed Natásha getting up. <q>If you
                            hadn’t interfered... Oh, my God! What is it all? What is it? Sónya,
                            why?... Go away!</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para">And she burst into sobs with the despairing vehemence with
                        which people bewail disasters they feel they have themselves occasioned.
                        Márya Dmítrievna was to speak again but Natásha cried out: <q>Go away! Go
                            away! You all hate and despise me!</q> and she threw herself back on the
                        sofa.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Márya Dmítrievna put a pillow under her head, covered her
                        with two quilts, and herself brought her some lime-flower water, but Natásha
                        did not respond to her.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Well, let her sleep,</q> said Márya Dmítrievna as she
                        went out of the room supposing Natásha to be asleep.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">But Natásha was not asleep; with pale face and fixed
                        wide-open eyes she looked straight before her. All that night she did not
                        sleep or weep and did not speak to Sónya who got up and went to her several
                        times.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">With compressed and parched lips and dry fixed eyes, she
                        sat at the window, uneasily watching the people who drove past and hurriedly
                        glancing round at anyone who entered the room. She was evidently expecting
                        news of him and that he would come or would write to her.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">When he returned to Moscow Pierre was handed a letter from
                        Márya Dmítrievna asking him to come and see her on a matter of great
                        importance relating to Andrew Bolkónski and his betrothed.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>What can have happened? And what can they want with
                            me?</q> thought he as he dressed to go to Márya Dmítrievna’s.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Yes, indeed, that’s a true sage,</q> thought Pierre.
                            <q>He sees nothing beyond the pleasure of the moment, nothing troubles
                            him and so he is always cheerful, satisfied, and serene. What wouldn’t I
                            give to be like him!</q> he thought enviously.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Márya Dmítrievna informed him that Natásha had refused
                        Prince Andrew without her parents’ knowledge and that the cause of this was
                        Anatole Kurágin into whose society Pierre’s wife had thrown her and with
                        whom Natásha had tried to elope during her father’s absence, in order to be
                        married secretly.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Pierre raised his shoulders and listened open-mouthed to
                        what was told him, scarcely able to believe his own ears. That Prince
                        Andrew’s deeply loved affianced wife—the same Natásha Rostóva who used to be
                        so charming—should give up Bolkónski for that fool Anatole who was already
                        secretly married (as Pierre knew), and should be so in love with him as to
                        agree to run away with him, was something Pierre could not conceive and
                        could not imagine.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>They are all alike!</q> he said to himself, reflecting
                        that he was not the only man unfortunate enough to be tied to a bad woman.
                        But still he pitied Prince Andrew to the point of tears and sympathized with
                        his wounded pride, and the more he pitied his friend the more did he think
                        with contempt and even with disgust of that Natásha who had just passed him
                        in the ballroom with such a look of cold dignity.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Natásha looked from one to the other as a hunted and
                        wounded animal looks at the approaching dogs and sportsmen.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">She was afraid that the count or Bolkónski, who might
                        arrive at any moment, if they knew of this affair (which she hoped to hide
                        from them) might challenge Anatole to a duel, and she therefore asked Pierre
                        to tell his brother-in-law in her name to leave Moscow and not dare to let
                        her set eyes on him again. Pierre—only now realizing the danger to the old
                        count, Nicholas, and Prince Andrew—promised to do as she wished.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">He drove through the town seeking Anatole Kurágin, at the
                        thought of whom now the blood rushed to his heart and he felt a difficulty
                        in breathing. He was not at the ice hills, nor at the gypsies’, nor at
                        Komoneno’s. Pierre drove to the Club. In the Club all was going on as usual.
                        The members who were assembling for dinner were sitting about in groups;
                        they greeted Pierre and spoke of the town news.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">One of Pierre’s acquaintances, while they were talking
                        about the weather, asked if he had heard of Kurágin’s abduction of Rostóva
                        which was talked of in the town, and was it true? Pierre laughed and said it
                        was nonsense for he had just come from the Rostóvs’.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">It seemed to him essential to see Natásha. In the evening
                        he drove to his sister’s to discuss with her how to arrange a meeting. When
                        Pierre returned home after vainly hunting all over Moscow, his valet
                        informed him that Prince Anatole was with the countess.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Pierre without greeting his wife whom he had not seen since
                        his return—at that moment she was more repulsive to him than ever—entered
                        the drawing room and seeing Anatole went up to him.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Ah, Pierre,</q> said the countess going up to her
                        husband. <q>You don’t know what a plight our Anatole...</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Where you are, there is vice and evil!</q> said Pierre
                        to his wife. <q>Anatole, come with me! I must speak to you,</q> he added in
                        French.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Anatole followed him with his usual jaunty step but his
                        face betrayed anxiety.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Having entered his study Pierre closed the door and
                        addressed Anatole without looking at him.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">
                        <q>You promised Countess Rostóva to marry her and were about to elope with
                            her, is that so?</q>
                    </p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Mon cher,</q> answered Anatole (their whole conversation
                        was in French), <q>I don’t consider myself bound to answer questions put to
                            me in that tone.</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Pierre’s face, already pale, became distorted by fury. He
                        seized Anatole by the collar of his uniform with his big hand and shook him
                        from side to side till Anatole’s face showed a sufficient degree of
                        terror.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>When I tell you that I must talk to you!...</q> repeated
                        Pierre. <q>Come now, this is stupid. What?</q> said Anatole, fingering a
                        button of his collar that had been wrenched loose with a bit of the cloth.
                            <q>You’re a scoundrel and a blackguard, and I don’t know what deprives
                            me from the pleasure of smashing your head with this!</q> said Pierre,
                        expressing himself so artificially because he was talking French.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">
                        <q>Did you promise to marry her?</q>
                        <q>I... I didn’t think of it. I never promised, because...</q>
                    </p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Have you any letters of hers? Any letters?</q> he said,
                        moving toward Anatole.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>I shan’t be violent, don’t be afraid!</q> said Pierre in
                        answer to a frightened gesture of Anatole’s. <q>First, the letters,</q> said
                        he, as if repeating a lesson to himself. <q>Secondly,</q> he continued after
                        a short pause, again rising and again pacing the room, <q>tomorrow you must
                            get out of Moscow.</q>
                        <q>But how can I?...</q>
                        <q>Thirdly,</q> Pierre continued without listening to him, <q>you must never
                            breathe a word of what has passed between you and Countess Rostóva. I
                            know I can’t prevent your doing so, but if you have a spark of
                            conscience...</q> Pierre paced the room several times in silence.
                        Anatole sat at a table frowning and biting his lips.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">
                        <q>After all, you must understand that besides your pleasure there is such a
                            thing as other people’s happiness and peace, and that you are ruining a
                            whole life for the sake of amusing yourself! Amuse yourself with women
                            like my wife—with them you are within your rights, for they know what
                            you want of them. They are armed against you by the same experience of
                            debauchery; but to promise a maid to marry her... to deceive, to
                            kidnap.... Don’t you understand that it is as mean as beating an old man
                            or a child?...</q>
                    </p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>I don’t know about that, eh?</q> said Anatole, growing
                        more confident as Pierre mastered his wrath. <q>I don’t know that and don’t
                            want to,</q> he said, not looking at Pierre and with a slight tremor of
                        his lower jaw, <q>but you have used such words to me—mean and so on—which as
                            a man of honor I can’t allow anyone to use.</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Is it satisfaction you want?</q> said Pierre ironically.
                            <q>You could at least take back your words. What? If you want me to do
                            as you wish, eh?</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>I take them back, I take them back!</q> said Pierre,
                            <q>and I ask you to forgive me.</q> Pierre involuntarily glanced at the
                        loose button. <q>And if you require money for your journey...</q> Anatole
                        smiled. The expression of that base and cringing smile, which Pierre knew so
                        well in his wife, revolted him. <q>Oh, vile and heartless brood!</q> he
                        exclaimed, and left the room. Next day Anatole left for Petersburg.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">The whole house was in a state of alarm and commotion.
                        Natásha was very ill, having, as Márya Dmítrievna told him in secret,
                        poisoned herself the night after she had been told that Anatole was married,
                        with some arsenic she had stealthily procured. After swallowing a little she
                        had been so frightened that she woke Sónya and told her what she had done.
                        The necessary antidotes had been administered in time and she was now out of
                        danger, though still so weak that it was out of the question to move her to
                        the country, and so the countess had been sent for.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">He was awaiting Prince Andrew’s return with dread and went
                        every day to the old prince’s for news of him.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Well, how are you? Still getting stouter?</q> he said
                        with animation, but the new wrinkle on his forehead deepened. <q>Yes, I am
                            well,</q> he said in answer to Pierre’s question, and smiled.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">
                        <q>Forgive me for troubling you....</q>
                    </p>
                    <p class="flex-para">
                        <q>I have received a refusal from Countess Rostóva and have heard reports of
                            your brother-in-law having sought her hand, or something of that kind.
                            Is that true?</q>
                    </p>
                    <p class="flex-para">
                        <q>Here are her letters and her portrait,</q> said he. He took the packet
                        from the table and handed it to Pierre. <q>Give this to the countess... if
                            you see her.</q>
                        <q>She is very ill,</q> said Pierre. </p>
                    <p class="flex-para">
                        <q>He left long ago. She has been at death’s door.</q>
                        <q>I much regret her illness,</q> said Prince Andrew; and he smiled like his
                        father, coldly, maliciously, and unpleasantly. </p>
                    <p class="flex-para">
                        <q>Well, it doesn’t matter,</q> said Prince Andrew. <q>Tell Countess Rostóva
                            that she was and is perfectly free and that I wish her all that is
                            good.</q> Pierre took the packet. Prince Andrew, as if trying to
                        remember whether he had something more to say, or waiting to see if Pierre
                        would say anything, looked fixedly at him. <q>I say, do you remember our
                            discussion in Petersburg?</q> asked Pierre, <q>about...</q>
                        <q>Yes,</q> returned Prince Andrew hastily. <q>I said that a fallen woman
                            should be forgiven, but I didn’t say I could forgive her. I can’t.</q>
                    </p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Prince Andrew interrupted him and cried sharply: <q>Yes,
                            ask her hand again, be magnanimous, and so on?... Yes, that would be
                            very noble, but I am unable to follow in that gentleman’s footsteps. If
                            you wish to be my friend never speak to me of that... of all that! Well,
                            good-by. So you’ll give her the packet?</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Natásha was standing in the middle of the drawing room,
                        emaciated, with a pale set face, but not at all shamefaced as Pierre
                        expected to find her. When he appeared at the door she grew flurried,
                        evidently undecided whether to go to meet him or to wait till he came
                        up.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Pierre hastened to her. He thought she would give him her
                        hand as usual; but she, stepping up to him, stopped, breathing heavily, her
                        arms hanging lifelessly just in the pose she used to stand in when she went
                        to the middle of the ballroom to sing, but with quite a different expression
                        of face.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Peter Kirílovich,</q> she began rapidly, <q>Prince
                            Bolkónski was your friend—is your friend,</q> she corrected herself. (It
                        seemed to her that everything that had once been must now be different.)
                            <q>He told me once to apply to you...</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Pierre sniffed as he looked at her, but did not speak. Till
                        then he had reproached her in his heart and tried to despise her, but he now
                        felt so sorry for her that there was no room in his soul for reproach.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">
                        <q>He is here now: tell him... to for... forgive me!</q> She stopped and
                        breathed still more quickly, but did not shed tears. <q>Yes... I will tell
                            him,</q> answered Pierre; <q>but...</q>
                    </p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>No, I know all is over,</q> she said hurriedly. <q>No,
                            that can never be. I’m only tormented by the wrong I have done him. Tell
                            him only that I beg him to forgive, forgive, forgive me for
                            everything....</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>I will tell him, I will tell him everything once
                            more,</q> said Pierre. <q>But... I should like to know one
                        thing....</q></p>
                    <p class="flex-para">
                        <q>I should like to know, did you love...</q> Pierre did not know how to
                        refer to Anatole and flushed at the thought of him—<q>did you love that bad
                            man?</q>
                        <q>Don’t call him bad!</q> said Natásha. <q>But I don’t know, don’t know at
                            all....</q>
                    </p>
                    <p class="flex-para">She began to cry and a still greater sense of pity,
                        tenderness, and love welled up in Pierre. He felt the tears trickle under
                        his spectacles and hoped they would not be noticed.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">
                        <q>We won’t speak of it any more, my dear,</q> said Pierre, and his gentle,
                        cordial tone suddenly seemed very strange to Natásha. <q>We won’t speak of
                            it, my dear—I’ll tell him everything; but one thing I beg of you,
                            consider me your friend and if you want help, advice, or simply to open
                            your heart to someone—not now, but when your mind is clearer--think of
                            me!</q> He took her hand and kissed it. <q>I shall be happy if it’s in
                            my power...</q>
                    </p>
                    <p class="flex-para"> Pierre grew confused. <q>Don’t speak to me like that. I am
                            not worth it!</q> exclaimed Natásha and turned to leave the room, but
                        Pierre held her hand. </p>
                    <p class="flex-para">
                        <q>Stop, stop! You have your whole life before you,</q> said he to her.
                            <q>Before me? No! All is over for me,</q> she replied with shame and
                        self-abasement. <q>All over?</q> he repeated. <q>If I were not myself, but
                            the handsomest, cleverest, and best man in the world, and were free, I
                            would this moment ask on my knees for your hand and your love!</q> For
                        the first time for many days Natásha wept tears of gratitude and tenderness,
                        and glancing at Pierre she went out of the room. </p>
                    <p class="flex-para">Pierre too when she had gone almost ran into the anteroom,
                        restraining tears of tenderness and joy that choked him, and without finding
                        the sleeves of his fur cloak threw it on and got into his sleigh.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Where to?</q> Pierre asked himself. <q>Where can I go
                            now? Surely not to the Club or to pay calls?</q> All men seemed so
                        pitiful, so poor, in comparison with this feeling of tenderness and love he
                        experienced: in comparison with that softened, grateful, last look she had
                        given him through her tears.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para"><q>Home!</q> said Pierre, and despite twenty-two degrees of
                        frost Fahrenheit he threw open the bearskin cloak from his broad chest and
                        inhaled the air with joy.</p>
                    <p class="flex-para">It was clear and frosty. Above the dirty, ill-lit streets,
                        above the black roofs, stretched the dark starry sky. Only looking up at the
                        sky did Pierre cease to feel how sordid and humiliating were all mundane
                        things compared with the heights to which his soul had just been raised. At
                        the entrance to the Arbát Square an immense expanse of dark starry sky
                        presented itself to his eyes. Almost in the center of it, above the
                        Prechístenka Boulevard, surrounded and sprinkled on all sides by stars but
                        distinguished from them all by its nearness to the earth, its white light,
                        and its long uplifted tail, shone the enormous and brilliant comet of
                        1812—the comet which was said to portend all kinds of woes and the end of
                        the world. In Pierre, however, that comet with its long luminous tail
                        aroused no feeling of fear. On the contrary he gazed joyfully, his eyes
                        moist with tears, at this bright comet which, having traveled in its orbit
                        with inconceivable velocity through immeasurable space, seemed suddenly—like
                        an arrow piercing the earth—to remain fixed in a chosen spot, vigorously
                        holding its tail erect, shining and displaying its white light amid
                        countless other scintillating stars. It seemed to Pierre that this comet
                        fully responded to what was passing in his own softened and uplifted soul,
                        now blossoming into a new life.</p>

                    <p class="flex-para">Writing the words L’Empereur Napoléon in numbers, it
                        appears that the sum of them is 666, and that Napoleon was therefore the
                        beast foretold in the Apocalypse. Moreover, by applying the same system to
                        the words quarante-deux, * which was the term allowed to the beast that
                            <q>spoke great things and blasphemies,</q> the same number 666 was
                        obtained; from which it followed that the limit fixed for Napoleon’s power
                        had come in the year 1812 when the French emperor was forty-two. This
                        prophecy pleased Pierre very much and he often asked himself what would put
                        an end to the power of the beast, that is, of Napoleon, and tried by the
                        same system of using letters as numbers and adding them up, to find an
                        answer to the question that engrossed him. He wrote the words L’Empereur
                        Alexandre, La nation russe and added up their numbers, but the sums were
                        either more or less than 666. Once when making such calculations he wrote
                        down his own name in French, Comte Pierre Besouhoff, but the sum of the
                        numbers did not come right. Then he changed the spelling, substituting a z
                        for the s and adding de and the article le, still without obtaining the
                        desired result. Then it occurred to him: if the answer to the question were
                        contained in his name, his nationality would also be given in the answer. So
                        he wrote Le russe Besuhof and adding up the numbers got 671. This was only
                        five too much, and five was represented by e, the very letter elided from
                        the article le before the word Empereur. By omitting the e, though
                        incorrectly, Pierre got the answer he sought. L’russe Besuhof made 666. This
                        discovery excited him. How, or by what means, he was connected with the
                        great event foretold in the Apocalypse he did not know, but he did not doubt
                        that connection for a moment. His love for Natásha, Antichrist, Napoleon,
                        the invasion, the comet, 666, L’Empereur Napoléon, and L’russe Besuhof—all
                        this had to mature and culminate, to lift him out of that spellbound, petty
                        sphere of Moscow habits in which he felt himself held captive and lead him
                        to a great achievement and great happiness.</p>
