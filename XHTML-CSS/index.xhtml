            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812 is a work that takes on a tremendous
                task: adaptation of Leo Tolstoy’s staggering masterwork, War and Peace. The novel is
                a work of art like no other, interrogating Russian society, the psychology of war,
                and the philosophy of human emotion (and pretty much everything else under the sun).
                As such, one tends to wonder– how does the Broadway musical get on in adapting (and
                most importantly, condensing) the themes and deep character relationships of this
                opus into an understandable and average length musical?</p>
            <h3>ABOUT THE DEVELOPERS</h3>
            <p>Ella Fosse (she/her) is a sophomore currently pursuing History and Museum Studies
                majors, along with some other ventures with a French minor and a Russian and Eastern
                European Studies certificate. Her favorite song from Great Comet is either "Dust and
                Ashes" or "Letters", but Great Comet is her all-time favorite musical, so she loves
                them all!</p>

            <p>Madeline Leatherbarrow (she/her) is a senior at the University of Pittsburgh studying
                Psychology and Linguistics with a minor in Irish. Her favorite song from Great Comet
                is "Natasha &amp; Bolkonskys" specifically for the musical aspect; the dissonance in
                the song is amazing and horrible all at once, which sets the tone for the song and
                its characters perfectly.</p>

            <p>Mikey Montoni (she/her) is a junior at the University of Pittsburgh studying
                nonfiction writing with minors in film and English literature. Her favorite song
                from Great Comet is “Moscow,” not for any musical reason, but because its role in
                the story intrigues her.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Much thanks to Emma Schwarz and Professor David Birnbaum for their help on this
                project! This project could not have gone on without their guidance and support.</p>
