               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref1">Pierre without any apparent cause suddenly felt it
                  impossible to go on living as before.</p>
               <hr />
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref2">Only the skeleton of life remained: his house, a
                  brilliant wife who now enjoyed the favors of a very important personage,
                  acquaintance with all Petersburg, and his court service with its dull
                  formalities.</p>
               <hr />
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref3">And this life suddenly seemed to Pierre
                  unexpectedly loathsome.</p>
               <hr />
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref5">Moscow society, from the old women down to the
                  children, received Pierre like a long-expected guest whose place was always ready
                  awaiting him. For Moscow society Pierre was the nicest, kindest, most
                  intellectual, merriest, and most magnanimous of cranks, a heedless, genial
                  nobleman of the old Russian type. His purse was always empty because it was open
                  to everyone.</p>
               <hr />
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref6">Il est charmant; il n’a pas de sexe, they said of
                  him. He is charming; he has no sex.</p>
               <hr />
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref7">Pierre was one of those retired
                  gentlemen-in-waiting of whom there were hundreds good-humoredly ending their days
                  in Moscow.</p>
               <hr />
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref8">Sometimes he consoled himself with the thought that
                  he was only living this life temporarily; but then he was shocked by the thought
                  of how many, like himself, had entered that life and that club temporarily, with
                  all their teeth and hair, and had only left it when not a single tooth or hair
                  remained.</p>
               <hr />
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref9">In moments of pride, when he thought of his
                  position it seemed to him that he was quite different and distinct from those
                  other retired gentlemen-in-waiting he had formerly despised: they were empty,
                  stupid, contented fellows, satisfied with their position, while I am still
                  discontented and want to do something for mankind. But perhaps all these comrades
                  of mine struggled just like me and sought something new, a path in life of their
                  own, and like me were brought by force of circumstances, society, and race—by that
                  elemental force against which man is powerless—to the condition I am in, said he
                  to himself in moments of humility; and after living some time in Moscow he no
                  longer despised, but began to grow fond of, to respect, and to pity his comrades
                  in destiny, as he pitied himself.</p>
               <hr />
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref10">So thought Pierre, and the whole of this general
                  deception which everyone accepts, accustomed as he was to it, astonished him each
                  time as if it were something new. I understand the deception and confusion, he
                  thought, but how am I to tell them all that I see? I have tried, and have always
                  found that they too in the depths of their souls understand it as I do, and only
                  try not to see it. So it appears that it must be so! But I—what is to become of
                  me?</p>
               <hr />
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref12">It doesn’t matter. I’ll get it unraveled. I have a
                  solution ready, but have no time now—I’ll think it all out later on! But the later
                  on never came.</p>
