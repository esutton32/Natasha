                  was very ill, having, as Márya Dmítrievna told him in secret, poisoned
                  herself the night after she had been told that Anatole was married, with
                  some arsenic she had stealthily procured. After swallowing a little she had been so
                  frightened that she woke Sónya and told her what she had done. The
                  necessary antidotes had been administered in time and she was now out of danger,
                  though still so weak that it was out of the question to move her to the country, and
                  so the countess had been sent for.</p>
