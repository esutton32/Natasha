                  commotion. Natásha was very ill, having, as Márya Dmítrievna told him in secret,
                  poisoned herself the night after she had been told that Anatole was married, with
                  some arsenic she had stealthily procured. After swallowing a little she had been
                  so frightened that she woke Sónya and told her what she had done. The necessary
                  antidotes had been administered in time and she was now out of danger, though
                  still so weak that it was out of the question to move her to the country, and so
                  the countess had been sent for.</p>
