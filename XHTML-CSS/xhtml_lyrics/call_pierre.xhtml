               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref154">When he returned to Moscow Pierre was handed a letter from
                  Márya Dmítrievna asking him to come and see her on a matter of great
                  importance relating to Andrew Bolkónski and his betrothed.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref155">What can have happened? And what can they want with me? thought he
                  as he dressed to go to Márya Dmítrievna’s.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref157">Márya Dmítrievna informed him that Natásha had refused
                  Prince Andrew without her parents’ knowledge and that the cause of this
                  was Anatole Kurágin into whose society Pierre’s wife had thrown
                  her and with whom Natásha had tried to elope during her father’s absence,
                  in order to be married secretly.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref158">Pierre raised his shoulders and listened open-mouthed to what
                  was told him, scarcely able to believe his own ears. That Prince Andrew’s
                  deeply loved affianced wife—the same Natásha Rostóva who used to be so
                  charming—should give up Bolkónski for that fool Anatole who was already
                  secretly married (as Pierre knew), and should be so in love with him as to
                  agree to run away with him, was something Pierre could not conceive and
                  could not imagine.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref159">They are all alike! he said to himself, reflecting that he was not
                  the only man unfortunate enough to be tied to a bad woman. But still he pitied
                  Prince Andrew to the point of tears and sympathized with his wounded
                  pride, and the more he pitied his friend the more did he think with contempt and
                  even with disgust of that Natásha who had just passed him in the ballroom
                  with such a look of cold dignity.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref160">Natásha looked from one to the other as a hunted and wounded animal looks
                  at the approaching dogs and sportsmen.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref161">She was afraid that the count or Bolkónski, who might arrive at any
                  moment, if they knew of this affair (which she hoped to hide from them) might
                  challenge Anatole to a duel, and she therefore asked Pierre to
                  tell his brother-in-law in her name to leave Moscow and not dare to let her set eyes
                  on him again. Pierre—only now realizing the danger to the old count,
                  Nicholas, and Prince Andrew—promised to do as she wished.</p>
