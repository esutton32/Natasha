                  How is it you’re not ashamed to bury such pearls in the country?

               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref59">Countess Bezúkhova quite deserved her reputation of being a
                  fascinating woman. She could say what she did not think—especially what was
                  flattering—quite simply and naturally.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref81">Oh, my enchantress! she cried to the blushing Natásha.
                  Charming! No, this is really beyond anything, my dear count, said she to
                  Count Rostóv who had followed her in. How can you live in Moscow and
                  go nowhere?</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref82">She looked at Natásha’s dresses and praised them, as well as a
                  new dress of her own made of metallic gauze, which she had received from
                  Paris, and advised Natásha to have one like it.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref83">But anything suits you, my charmer! she remarked.</p>

               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref84">The idea of throwing her brother and Natásha together amused
                  her.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref85">
                  My brother dined with me yesterday—we nearly died of laughter—he ate nothing and
                  kept sighing for you, my charmer! He is madly, quite madly, in love with you, my
                  dear.
               </p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref86">How she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty! said Hélène.
                  You must certainly come. If you love somebody, my charmer, that is not a
                  reason to shut yourself up. Even if you are engaged, I am sure your fiancé would
                  wish you to go into society rather than be bored to death.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref87">So she knows I am engaged, and she and her husband
                  Pierre—that good Pierre—have talked and laughed about this. So
                  it’s all right. And again, under Hélène’s influence, what had
                  seemed terrible now seemed simple and natural. And she is such a grande dame, so
                  kind, and evidently likes me so much. And why not enjoy myself? thought
                  Natásha, gazing at Hélène with wide-open, wondering
                  eyes.</p>
