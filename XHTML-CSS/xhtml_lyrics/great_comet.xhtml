               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref203">Where to?
                  Pierre asked himself. Where can I go now? Surely not to the Club or to
                  pay calls? All men seemed so pitiful, so poor, in comparison with this
                  feeling of tenderness and love he experienced: in comparison with that softened,
                  grateful, last look she had given him through her tears.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref205">It was clear and frosty. Above the dirty, ill-lit streets, above the
                  black roofs, stretched the dark starry sky. Only looking up at the sky did
                  Pierre cease to feel how sordid and humiliating were all mundane things
                  compared with the heights to which his soul had just been raised. At the entrance
                  to
                  the Arbát Square an immense expanse of dark starry sky presented itself to his eyes.
                  Almost in the center of it, above the Prechístenka Boulevard, surrounded and
                  sprinkled on all sides by stars but distinguished from them all by its nearness to
                  the earth, its white light, and its long uplifted tail, shone the enormous and
                  brilliant comet of 1812—the comet which was said to portend all kinds of woes and
                  the end of the world. In Pierre, however, that comet with its long luminous
                  tail aroused no feeling of fear. On the contrary he gazed joyfully, his eyes moist
                  with tears, at this bright comet which, having traveled in its orbit with
                  inconceivable velocity through immeasurable space, seemed suddenly—like an arrow
                  piercing the earth—to remain fixed in a chosen spot, vigorously holding its tail
                  erect, shining and displaying its white light amid countless other scintillating
                  stars. It seemed to Pierre that this comet fully responded to what was
                  passing in his own softened and uplifted soul, now blossoming into a new life.</p>
