               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref139">You shameless good-for-nothing! said she. I won’t hear a
                  word.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref140">Disgusting, abominable... In my house... horrid girl, hussy! I’m only
                  sorry for her father! thought she, trying to restrain her wrath.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref141">A nice girl! Very nice! said Márya Dmítrievna.
                  Arranging meetings with lovers in my house! It’s no use pretending: you
                  listen when I speak to you! And Márya Dmítrievna touched her arm.
                  Listen when I speak! You’ve disgraced yourself like the lowest of hussies.
                  I’d treat you differently, but I’m sorry for your father, so I will conceal
                  it.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref142">Natásha did not change her position, but her whole body heaved
                  with noiseless, convulsive sobs which choked her.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref143">It’s lucky for him that he escaped me; but I’ll find him! she said
                  in her rough voice. Do you hear what I am saying or not? she added.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref144">She put her large hand under Natásha’s face and turned it toward
                  her.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref145">Let me be!... What is it to me?... I shall die! she muttered,
                  wrenching herself from Márya Dmítrievna’s hands with a vicious effort and
                  sinking down again into her former position.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref146">But when your father comes back tomorrow what am I to tell him?
                  Eh? Again Natásha’s body shook with sobs. Suppose he finds out,
                  and your brother, and your betrothed?</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref147">I have no betrothed: I have refused him! cried Natásha.
                  That’s all the same, continued Márya Dmítrievna. If they hear
                  of this, will they let it pass? He, your father, I know him... if he challenges
                  him to a duel will that be all right? Eh?
                  Oh, let me be! Why have you interfered at all? Why? Why? Who asked you to?
                  shouted Natásha, raising herself on the sofa and looking malignantly at
                  Márya Dmítrievna.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref148">But what did you want? cried Márya Dmítrievna, growing
                  angry again. Were you kept under lock and key? Who hindered his coming to the
                  house? Why carry you off as if you were some gypsy singing girl?... Well, if he
                  had carried you off... do you think they wouldn’t have found him? Your father,
                  or brother, or your betrothed? And he’s a scoundrel, a wretch—that’s a fact!
                  He is better than any of you! exclaimed Natásha getting up. If
                  you hadn’t interfered... Oh, my God! What is it all? What is it? Sónya,
                  why?... Go away!</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref149">And she burst into sobs with the despairing vehemence with which people
                  bewail disasters they feel they have themselves occasioned. Márya
                  Dmítrievna was to speak again but Natásha cried out: Go away!
                  Go away! You all hate and despise me! and she threw herself back on the
                  sofa.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref150">Márya Dmítrievna put a pillow under her head, covered her with
                  two quilts, and herself brought her some lime-flower water, but Natásha did
                  not respond to her.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref151">Well, let her sleep, said Márya Dmítrievna as she went
                  out of the room supposing Natásha to be asleep.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref152">But Natásha was not asleep; with pale face and fixed wide-open
                  eyes she looked straight before her. All that night she did not sleep or weep and
                  did not speak to Sónya who got up and went to her several times.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref153">With compressed and parched lips and dry fixed eyes, she sat at the
                  window, uneasily watching the people who drove past and hurriedly glancing round at
                  anyone who entered the room. She was evidently expecting news of him and that he
                  would come or would write to her.</p>
