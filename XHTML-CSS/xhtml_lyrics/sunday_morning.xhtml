               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref76">She suffered more now than during her first days in Moscow. To her
                  impatience and pining for him were now added the unpleasant recollection of her
                  interview with Princess Mary and the old prince, and a fear and anxiety
                  of which she did not understand the cause. She continually fancied that either he
                  would never come or that something would happen to her before he came.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref77">As soon as she began to think of him, the recollection of the old prince,
                  of Princess Mary, of the theater, and of Kurágin mingled with
                  her thoughts. The question again presented itself whether she was not guilty,
                  whether she had not already broken faith with Prince Andrew, and again she
                  found herself recalling to the minutest detail every word, every gesture, and every
                  shade in the play of expression on the face of the man who had been able to arouse
                  in her such an incomprehensible and terrifying feeling.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref78">She wore her holiday shawl, in which she paid calls, and announced that
                  she was going to see Prince Nicholas Bolkónski to have an explanation
                  with him about Natásha.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref79">After she had gone, a dressmaker from Madame Suppert-Roguet waited on the
                  Rostóvs, and Natásha, very glad of this diversion, having shut herself into
                  a room adjoining the drawing room, occupied herself trying on the new dresses.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref80">Just as she had put on a bodice without sleeves and only tacked together,
                  and was turning her head to see in the glass how the back fitted, she heard in the
                  drawing room the animated sounds of her father’s voice and another’s—a woman’s—that
                  made her flush.</p>
