               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref116">Hard as it was for Sónya, she watched her friend and did not let
                  her out of her sight. The day before the count was to return, Sónya noticed
                  that Natásha sat by the drawing room window all the morning as if expecting
                  something and that she made a sign to an officer who drove past, whom Sónya
                  took to be Anatole. Sónya began watching her friend still more
                  attentively and noticed that at dinner and all that evening Natásha was in
                  a strange and unnatural state. She answered questions at random, began sentences she
                  did not finish, and laughed at everything.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref117">After tea Sónya noticed a housemaid at Natásha’s door
                  timidly waiting to let her pass. She let the girl go in, and then listening at the
                  door learned that another letter had been delivered. Then suddenly it became clear
                  to Sónya that Natásha had some dreadful plan for that evening.
                  Sónya knocked at her door. Natásha did not let her in.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref118">She will run away with him! thought Sónya. She is
                  capable of anything. There was something particularly pathetic and resolute in
                  her face today. She cried as she said good-by to Uncle,
                  Sónya remembered. Yes, that’s it, she means to elope with him, but what
                  am I to do? thought she, recalling all the signs that clearly indicated that
                  Natásha had some terrible intention. The count is away. What am I to
                  do? Write to Kurágin demanding an explanation? But what is there to
                  oblige him to reply? Write to Pierre, as Prince Andrew asked
                  me to in case of some misfortune?... But perhaps she really has already refused
                  Bolkónski—she sent a letter to Princess Mary yesterday. And Uncle is
                  away.... To tell Márya Dmítrievna who had such faith in
                  Natásha seemed to Sónya terrible. Well, anyway, thought
                  Sónya as she stood in the dark passage, now or never I must prove
                  that I remember the family’s goodness to me and that I love Nicholas. Yes! If I
                  don’t sleep for three nights I’ll not leave this passage and will hold her back
                  by force and will and not let the family be disgraced, thought she.</p>
