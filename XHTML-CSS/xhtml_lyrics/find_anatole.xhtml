               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref162">He drove through the town seeking Anatole Kurágin, at the
                  thought of whom now the blood rushed to his heart and he felt a difficulty in
                  breathing. He was not at the ice hills, nor at the gypsies’, nor at Komoneno’s.
                  Pierre drove to the Club. In the Club all was going on as usual. The
                  members who were assembling for dinner were sitting about in groups; they greeted
                  Pierre and spoke of the town news.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref163">One of Pierre’s acquaintances, while they were talking about the
                  weather, asked if he had heard of Kurágin’s abduction of Rostóva which was
                  talked of in the town, and was it true? Pierre laughed and said it was
                  nonsense for he had just come from the Rostóvs’.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref164">It seemed to him essential to see Natásha. In the evening he
                  drove to his sister’s to discuss with her how to arrange a meeting. When
                  Pierre returned home after vainly hunting all over Moscow, his valet
                  informed him that Prince Anatole was with the countess.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref165">Pierre without greeting his wife whom he had not seen since his
                  return—at that moment she was more repulsive to him than ever—entered the drawing
                  room and seeing Anatole went up to him.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref166">Ah, Pierre, said the countess going up to her husband.
                  You don’t know what a plight our Anatole...</p>

               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref167">Where you are, there is vice and evil! said Pierre to his
                  wife. Anatole, come with me! I must speak to you, he added in
                  French.</p>
