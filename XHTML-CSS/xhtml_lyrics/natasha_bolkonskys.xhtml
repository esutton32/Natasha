               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref28">From the first glance Princess Mary did not like Natásha. She thought her
                  too fashionably dressed, frivolously gay and vain. She did not at all realize that
                  before having seen her future sister-in-law she was prejudiced against her by
                  involuntary envy of her beauty, youth, and happiness, as well as by jealousy of her
                  brother’s love for her.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref29">Apart from this insuperable antipathy to her, Princess Mary was agitated
                  just then because on the Rostóvs’ being announced, the old prince had shouted that
                  he did not wish to see them, that Princess Mary might do so if she chose, but they
                  were not to be admitted to him. She had decided to receive them, but feared lest the
                  prince might at any moment indulge in some freak, as he seemed much upset by the
                  Rostóvs’ visit.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref30">I am so glad you should get to know one another... very sorry the
                  prince is still ailing, and after a few more commonplace remarks he
                  rose.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref31">She blushed for him, grew still angrier at having blushed, and looked at
                  the princess with a bold and defiant expression which said that she was not afraid
                  of anybody.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref32">Natásha felt offended by the hesitation she had noticed in the anteroom,
                  by her father’s nervousness, and by the unnatural manner of the princess who—she
                  thought—was making a favor of receiving her, and so everything displeased her. She
                  did not like Princess Mary, whom she thought very plain, affected, and dry.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref33">Natásha suddenly shrank into herself and involuntarily assumed an offhand
                  air which alienated Princess Mary still more. After five minutes of irksome,
                  constrained conversation, they heard the sound of slippered feet rapidly
                  approaching.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref34">I beg you to excuse me, excuse me! God is my witness, I did not
                  know, muttered the old man, and after looking Natásha over from head to foot
                  he went out.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref35">Dear Natalie, said Princess Mary, I want you to know that I am
                  glad my brother has found happiness....</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref36">I think, Princess, it is not convenient to speak of that now, she
                  said with external dignity and coldness, though she felt the tears choking her.
                  What have I said and what have I done? thought she, as soon as she was
                  out of the room.They waited a long time for Natásha to come to dinner that day. She
                  sat in her room crying like a child, blowing her nose and sobbing. Sónya stood
                  beside her, kissing her hair.  Natásha, what is it about? she asked. What
                  do they matter to you? It will all pass, Natásha.
                  But if you only knew how offensive it was... as if I...
                  Don’t talk about it, Natásha. It wasn’t your fault so why should you mind? Kiss
                  me, said Sónya.Natásha raised her head and, kissing her friend on the lips,
                  pressed her wet face against her. I can’t tell you, I don’t know. No one’s to
                  blame, said Natásha—It’s my fault. But it all hurts terribly. Oh, why
                  doesn’t he come?...
