               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref130">Balagá was a famous troyka driver who had known
                  Dólokhov and Anatole some six years and had given them good service with his
                  troykas. More than once when Anatole’s regiment was stationed at Tver he had taken
                  him from Tver in the evening, brought him to Moscow by daybreak, and driven him
                  back again the next night. More than once he had enabled Dólokhov to escape when
                  pursued. More than once he had driven them through the town with gypsies and
                  ladykins as he called the cocottes. More than once in their service he had run
                  over pedestrians and upset vehicles in the streets of Moscow and had always been
                  protected from the consequences by my gentlemen as he called them. He had ruined
                  more than one horse in their service. More than once they had beaten him, and more
                  than once they had made him drunk on champagne and Madeira, which he loved; and he
                  knew more than one thing about each of them which would long ago have sent an
                  ordinary man to Siberia. They often called Balagá into their orgies and made him
                  drink and dance at the gypsies’, and more than one thousand rubles of their money
                  had passed through his hands. In their service he risked his skin and his life
                  twenty times a year, and in their service had lost more horses than the money he
                  had from them would buy. But he liked them; liked that mad driving at twelve miles
                  an hour, liked upsetting a driver or running down a pedestrian, and flying at full
                  gallop through the Moscow streets. He liked to hear those wild, tipsy shouts
                  behind him: Get on! Get on! when it was impossible to go any faster. He liked
                  giving a painful lash on the neck to some peasant who, more dead than alive, was
                  already hurrying out of his way. Real gentlemen! he considered them.</p>
