                  that is good.
                  
                  Pierre took the packet. Prince Andrew, as if trying to remember
                  whether he had something more to say, or waiting to see if Pierre would
                  say anything, looked fixedly at him.
                  
                  I say, do you remember our discussion in Petersburg? asked
                  Pierre, about...
                  
                  Yes, returned Prince Andrew hastily. I said that a fallen
                  woman should be forgiven, but I didn’t say I could forgive her. I
                  can’t.

                  am unable to follow in that gentleman’s footsteps. If you wish to be my friend
                  never speak to me of that... of all that! Well, good-by. So you’ll give her the
                  packet?</p>
