               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref4">In Moscow as soon as he entered his huge house in which the faded and
                  fading princesses still lived, with its enormous retinue; as soon as, driving
                  through the town, he saw the Iberian shrine with innumerable tapers burning before
                  the golden covers of the icons, the Krémlin Square with its snow undisturbed by
                  vehicles, the sleigh drivers and hovels of the Sívtsev Vrazhók, those old Moscovites
                  who desired nothing, hurried nowhere, and were ending their days leisurely; when he
                  saw those old Moscow ladies, the Moscow balls, and the English Club, he felt himself
                  at home in a quiet haven.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref22">Then she had dinner, a substantial and appetizing meal at which there
                  were always three or four guests; after dinner she played a game of boston, and at
                  night she had the newspapers or a new book read to her while she knitted.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref23">The count’s things? Bring them here, she said, pointing to the
                  portmanteaus and not greeting anyone. The young ladies’? There to the left. Now
                  what are you dawdling for? she cried to the maids. Get the samovar
                  ready!... You’ve grown plumper and prettier, she remarked, drawing Natásha
                  (whose cheeks were glowing from the cold) to her by the hood. Foo! You are cold!
                  Now take off your things, quick! she shouted to the count who was going to
                  kiss her hand. You’re half frozen, I’m sure! Bring some rum for tea!... Bonjour,
                  Sónya dear! she added, turning to Sónya and indicating by this French
                  greeting her slightly contemptuous though affectionate attitude toward her.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref24">All right. All right. They’ll be safe with me, as safe as in Chancery!
                  I’ll take them where they must go, scold them a bit, and pet them a bit,
                  said Márya Dmítrievna, touching her goddaughter and favorite, Natásha, on the cheek
                  with her large hand.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref25">Well, now we’ll talk. I congratulate you on your betrothed. You’ve
                  hooked a fine fellow! I am glad for your sake and I’ve known him since he was so
                  high. She held her hand a couple of feet from the ground. Natásha
                  blushed happily. I like him and all his family. Now listen! You know that old
                  Prince Nicholas much dislikes his son’s marrying. The old
                  fellow’s crotchety! Of course Prince Andrew is not a child and can
                  shift without him, but it’s not nice to enter a family against a father’s will.
                  One wants to do it peacefully and lovingly. You’re a clever girl and you’ll know
                  how to manage. Be kind, and use your wits. Then all will be well.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref26">Natásha remained silent, from shyness Márya Dmítrievna supposed, but
                  really because she disliked anyone interfering in what touched her love of Prince
                  Andrew, which seemed to her so apart from all human affairs that no one could
                  understand it. She loved and knew Prince Andrew, he loved her only, and was to come
                  one of these days and take her. She wanted nothing more.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref38">
                  I can’t bear this waiting and I shall cry in a minute!
               </p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref39">Natásha at that moment felt so softened and tender that it was not enough
                  for her to love and know she was beloved, she wanted now, at once, to embrace the
                  man she loved, to speak and hear from him words of love such as filled her
                  heart.</p>
