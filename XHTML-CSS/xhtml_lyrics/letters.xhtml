                  to save oneself from it as best one can, thought Pierre. Only not to see
                  it, that dreadful it!</p>

               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref100">What am I to do if I love him and the other one too? she asked

               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref101">Princess Mary wrote that she was in despair at the
                  misunderstanding that had occurred between them. Whatever her father’s feelings
                  might be, she begged Natásha to believe that she could not help loving her
                  as the one chosen by her brother, for whose happiness she was ready to sacrifice
                  everything.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref102">Do not think, however, she wrote, that my father is
                  ill-disposed toward you. He is an invalid and an old man who must be forgiven;
                  but he is good and magnanimous and will love her who makes his son happy.
                  Princess Mary went on to ask Natásha to fix a time when she
                  could see her again.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref103">Dear Princess, she wrote in French quickly and mechanically, and
                  then paused. What more could she write after all that had happened the evening
                  before? Yes, yes! All that has happened, and now all is changed, she thought
                  as she sat with the letter she had begun before her. Must I break off with him?
                  Must I really? That’s awful... and to escape from these dreadful thoughts
                  she went to Sónya and began sorting patterns with her.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref104">Only, for Christ’s sake... the girl went on, as Natásha,
                  without thinking, mechanically broke the seal and read a love letter from
                  Anatole, of which, without taking in a word, she understood only that
                  it was a letter from him—from the man she loved. Yes, she loved him, or else how
                  could that have happened which had happened? And how could she have a love letter
                  from him in her hand?</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref105">With trembling hands Natásha held that passionate love letter
                  which Dólokhov had composed for Anatole</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref106">Since yesterday evening my fate has been sealed; to be loved by you or
                  to die. There is no other way for me, the letter began. Then he went on to
                  say that he knew her parents would not give her to him—for this there were secret
                  reasons he could reveal only to her—but that if she loved him she need only say the
                  word yes, and no human power could hinder their bliss. Love would conquer all. He
                  would steal her away and carry her off to the ends of the earth.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref107">Yes, yes! I love him! thought Natásha, reading the letter
                  for the twentieth time and finding some peculiarly deep meaning in each word of
                  it.</p>

               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref218">Writing the words L’Empereur Napoléon in numbers, it appears that the sum of them
                  is
                  666, and that Napoleon was therefore the beast foretold in the Apocalypse. Moreover,
                  by applying the same system to the words quarante-deux, * which was the term allowed
                  to the beast that spoke great things and blasphemies, the same number 666 was
                  obtained; from which it followed that the limit fixed for Napoleon’s power had come
                  in the year 1812 when the French emperor was forty-two. This prophecy pleased Pierre
                  very much and he often asked himself what would put an end to the power of the
                  beast, that is, of Napoleon, and tried by the same system of using letters as
                  numbers and adding them up, to find an answer to the question that engrossed him.
                  He
                  wrote the words L’Empereur Alexandre, La nation russe and added up their numbers,
                  but the sums were either more or less than 666. Once when making such calculations
                  he wrote down his own name in French, Comte Pierre Besouhoff, but the sum of the
                  numbers did not come right. Then he changed the spelling, substituting a z for the
                  s
                  and adding de and the article le, still without obtaining the desired result. Then
                  it occurred to him: if the answer to the question were contained in his name, his
                  nationality would also be given in the answer. So he wrote Le russe Besuhof and
                  adding up the numbers got 671. This was only five too much, and five was represented
                  by e, the very letter elided from the article le before the word Empereur. By
                  omitting the e, though incorrectly, Pierre got the answer he sought. L’russe Besuhof
                  made 666. This discovery excited him. How, or by what means, he was connected with
                  the great event foretold in the Apocalypse he did not know, but he did not doubt
                  that connection for a moment. His love for Natásha, Antichrist, Napoleon, the
                  invasion, the comet, 666, L’Empereur Napoléon, and L’russe Besuhof—all this had to
                  mature and culminate, to lift him out of that spellbound, petty sphere of Moscow
                  habits in which he felt himself held captive and lead him to a great achievement and
                  great happiness.</p>
