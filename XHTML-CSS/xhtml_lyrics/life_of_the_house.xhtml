               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref14">The prince had aged very much that year. He showed marked signs of
                  senility by a tendency to fall asleep, forgetfulness of quite recent events,
                  remembrance of remote ones, and the childish vanity with which he accepted the role
                  of head of the Moscow opposition. In spite of this the old man inspired in all his
                  visitors alike a feeling of respectful veneration—especially of an evening when he
                  came in to tea in his old-fashioned coat and powdered wig and, aroused by anyone,
                  told his abrupt stories of the past, or uttered yet more abrupt and scathing
                  criticisms of the present. For them all, that old-fashioned house with its gigantic
                  mirrors, pre-Revolution furniture, powdered footmen, and the stern shrewd old man
                  (himself a relic of the past century) with his gentle daughter and the pretty
                  Frenchwoman who were reverently devoted to him presented a majestic and agreeable
                  spectacle.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref15">But the visitors did not reflect that besides the couple of hours during
                  which they saw their host, there were also twenty-two hours in the day during which
                  the private and intimate life of the house continued.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref16">She did not go out into society; everyone knew that her father would not
                  let her go anywhere without him, and his failing health prevented his going out
                  himself, so that she was not invited to dinners and evening parties. She had quite
                  abandoned the hope of getting married.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref17">She saw the coldness and malevolence with which the old prince received
                  and dismissed the young men, possible suitors, who sometimes appeared at their
                  house. She had no friends</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref18">The idea that at the first moment of receiving the news of his son’s
                  intentions had occurred to him in jest—that if Andrew got married he himself would
                  marry Bourienne—had evidently pleased him</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref19">One day in Moscow in Princess Mary’s presence (she thought her father did
                  it purposely when she was there) the old prince kissed Mademoiselle Bourienne’s hand
                  and, drawing her to him, embraced her affectionately. Princess Mary flushed and ran
                  out of the room.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref20">
                  It’s horrible, vile, inhuman, to take advantage of the weakness...
               </p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref21">At such moments something like a pride of sacrifice gathered in her soul.
                  And suddenly that father whom she had judged would look for his spectacles in her
                  presence, fumbling near them and not seeing them, or would forget something that had
                  just occurred, or take a false step with his failing legs and turn to see if anyone
                  had noticed his feebleness, or, worst of all, at dinner when there were no visitors
                  to excite him would suddenly fall asleep, letting his napkin drop and his shaking
                  head sink over his plate. He is old and feeble, and I dare to condemn him!
                  she thought at such moments, with a feeling of revulsion against herself.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref27">They can’t help liking me, she thought. Everybody always has
                  liked me, and I am so willing to do anything they wish, so ready to be fond of
                  him—for being his father—and of her—for being his sister—that there is no reason
                  for them not to like me....</p>
