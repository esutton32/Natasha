               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref11">Though the doctors warned him that with his corpulence wine was dangerous
                  for him, he drank a great deal. He was only quite at ease when having poured several
                  glasses of wine mechanically into his large mouth he felt a pleasant warmth in his
                  body, an amiability toward all his fellows, and a readiness to respond superficially
                  to every idea without probing it deeply</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref70">There was a special reason for this, as he had got married two years
                  before—a fact known only to his most intimate friends. At that time while with his
                  regiment in Poland, a Polish landowner of small means had forced him to marry his
                  daughter.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref71">Anatole was always content with his position, with himself, and
                  with others. He was instinctively and thoroughly convinced that it was impossible
                  for him to live otherwise than as he did and that he had never in his life done
                  anything base. He was incapable of considering how his actions might affect others
                  or what the consequences of this or that action of his might be. He was convinced
                  that, as a duck is so made that it must live in water, so God had made him such that
                  he must spend thirty thousand rubles a year and always occupy a prominent position
                  in society.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref72">All he cared about was gaiety and women, and as according to his ideas
                  there was nothing dishonorable in these tastes, and he was incapable of considering
                  what the gratification of his tastes entailed for others, he honestly considered
                  himself irreproachable, sincerely despised rogues and bad people, and with a
                  tranquil conscience carried his head high.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref73">At supper after the opera he described to Dólokhov with the air
                  of a connoisseur the attractions of her arms, shoulders, feet, and hair and
                  expressed his intention of making love to her.</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref74">She’s first-rate, my dear fellow, but not for us, replied
                  Dólokhov. I will tell my sister to ask her to dinner, said
                  Anatole. Eh?
                  You’d better wait till she’s married....</p>

                  Well, now to the health of handsome women! said Dólokhov, and with a
                  serious expression, but with a smile lurking at the corners of his mouth, he
                  turned with his glass to Pierre.
                  Here’s to the health of lovely women, Peterkin—and their lovers! he
                  added.

                  smile of his which seemed to say, Ah! This is what I like!</p>
               <hr/>
               <p class="flex-para" id="wp-ref208">You...! you... scoundrel! I challenge you! he ejaculated, and,
                  pushing back his chair, he rose from the table.</p>
