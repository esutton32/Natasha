        <speaker>SERVANT</speaker>
        <line>May I present the Countess</line>
        <line>Natalya Rostova</line>

        <speaker>MARY</speaker>
        <line>Oh</line>
        <line>Oh, hello</line>
        <line>Wont you come in?</line>

        <speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
        <line>Hello</line>
        <direction>Natasha and Mary awkwardly move to a table in silence.</direction>

        <speaker>MARY</speaker>
        <line>And from the first glance I do not like Natasha</line>
        <line>Too fashionably dressed</line>
        <line>Frivolous and vain</line>
        <line>Her beauty, youth, and happiness</line>
        <line>My brothers love for her</line>

        <line>And my father</line>

        <speaker>BOLKONSKY</speaker>
        <line>I do not wish to see her!</line>

        <speaker>MARY</speaker>
        <line>I know at any moment he might indulge in some freak</line>

        <speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
        <line>Im sorry the Prince is still ailing</line>

        <speaker>BOLKONSKY</speaker>
        <line>Songstress!</line>

        <speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
        <line>I am not afraid of anyone</line>
        <line>But such hesitation</line>
        <line>Such unnatural manners</line>

        <line>And from the first glance I do not like Princess Mary</line>
        <line>Too plain and affected</line>
        <line>Insolent and dry</line>
        <line>I shrink into myself</line>
        <line>Assume an offhand air</line>

        <speaker>MARY</speaker>
        <line>Which alienates me still more</line>

        <speaker>NATASHA &amp; MARY</speaker>
        <line>Constrained and strained</line>
        <line>Constrained and strained</line>
        <line>Constrained and strained</line>
        <line>Irksome</line>
        <line>Irksome</line>

        <direction>The Prince enters in his underthings.</direction>

        <speaker>BOLKONSKY</speaker>
        <line>Oh!</line>

        <speaker>MARY</speaker>
        <line>Papa!</line>
        <speaker>BOLKONSKY</speaker>
        <line>Oh, so this is Natasha</line>
        <line>Not much to look at</line>
        <line>Says the mean old man in his underthings</line>
        <line>I never dress for children or peasants</line>
        <line>Says the mean old man in his underthings</line>

        <speaker>MARY</speaker>
        <line>And he looked at her once</line>
        <line>Head to toe</line>
        <line>And left muttering</line>

        <speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
        <line>I must take my leave</line>

        <speaker>MARY</speaker>
        <line>Please wait</line>

        <line>Dear Natalie</line>
        <line>I want you to know how glad I am my brother has found happiness</line>

        <speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
        <line>Is that the truth?</line>
        <line>I think it is not convenient to speak of that now</line>
        <line>Dear Princess</line>

        <speaker>MARY</speaker>
        <line>She said</line>
        <line>With such dignity and coldness</line>

        <speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
        <line>What have I said, what have I done?</line>
        <line>Crying like a child</line>
        <line>Oh, they were so awful!</line>
        <line>Oh, it all hurts so terribly</line>
        <line>Andrey</line>
        <line>Where are you?</line>
