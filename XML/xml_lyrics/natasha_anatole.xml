        <speaker>ANATOLE</speaker>
        <line>I have long wished to have this happiness</line>
        <line>Ever since the Naryshkins ball</line>
        <line>Where I had the well-remembered pleasure of seeing you</line>
        <line>How do you like the performance?</line>
        <line>Last week Semenova fell down on the stage</line>

        <speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
        <line>He is sensible and simple</line>
        <line>Bold and natural</line>
        <line>So strange and agreeable</line>
        <line>There is nothing formidable</line>
        <line>His smile is most naive</line>
        <line>Cheerful and good-natured</line>
        <line>And hes as handsome up close as at a distance</line>
        <line>And hes as handsome up close as at a distance</line>

        <speaker>ANATOLE</speaker>
        <line>And do you know, Natasha</line>
        <line>We are having a costume tournament soon</line>
        <line>You ought to come, please come!</line>

        <speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
        <line>Oh</line>

        <speaker>ANATOLE</speaker>
        <line>You ought to come, please come!</line>

        <speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
        <line>Oh, I</line>

        <speaker>ANATOLE</speaker>
        <line>And I never remove my smiling eyes</line>
        <line>From your face, your neck, your bare arms</line>
        <line>And I never remove my smiling eyes</line>
        <line>From your face, your neck, your bare arms</line>

        <speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
        <line>I know for certain that he is taken by me</line>
        <line>I know for certain that he is enraptured by me</line>
        <line>I feel him looking at my shoulders</line>
        <line>My face, my neck, my bare arms</line>

        <speaker>ANATOLE</speaker>
        <line>And I look you in the eye</line>

        <speaker>NATASHA &amp; ANATOLE</speaker>
        <line>And I look you in the eye</line>

        <speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
        <line>And looking into his eyes</line>
        <line>I am frightened</line>
        <line>Theres not that barrier of modesty</line>
        <line>Ive always felt with men</line>
        <line>I feel so terribly near</line>
        <line>I fear that he may seize me from behind</line>
        <line>And kiss me on the neck</line>

        <line>How do you like Moscow?</line>

        <speaker>ANATOLE</speaker>
        <line>At first I did not like it much</line>
        <line>Because what makes a town pleasant</line>
        <line>Ce sont les jolies femmes</line>
        <line>Isnt that so?</line>
        <line>But now I like it very much indeed</line>
        <line>Do come to the costume tournament Countess</line>
        <line>Do come!</line>
        <line>You will be the prettiest there</line>
        <line>You will be the prettiest there</line>
        <line>Do come, dear Countess, and give me this flower as a pledge</line>
        <line>We are speaking of most ordinary things</line>

        <speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
        <line>Yet I feel closer to you than Ive ever felt with any other man</line>
        <line>No one else is here</line>
        <line>No one else can see us</line>
        <line>Your eyes</line>
        <line>Your eyes</line>
        <line>Your eyes</line>
        <line>Oh your eyes</line>

        <speaker>ANATOLE</speaker>
        <line>Its all right, Natasha, Im here</line>

        <speaker>ANATOLE &amp; NATASHA</speaker>
        <line>So near</line>
        <line>Nothing between us</line>

        <line>Smile at me</line>
        <line>There is nothing between us</line>
