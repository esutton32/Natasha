        <speaker>SONYA</speaker>
        <line>Early Sunday morning</line>
        <line>Natasha and I lit a candle</line>
        <line>Looked in the mirror</line>

        <speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
        <line>I see my face</line>

        <speaker>SONYA</speaker>
        <line>Dont be silly</line>
        <line>They say you can see your future</line>
        <line>In the long row of candles</line>
        <line>Stretching back and back and back</line>
        <line>Into the depths of the mirror</line>
        <line>In the dim confused last square</line>
        <line>Youll see a coffin or a man</line>
        <line>Everyone sees a man</line>

        <speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
        <line>I see the candles</line>
        <line>Stretching back</line>
        <line>So far away</line>
        <line>I see the mirrors</line>
        <line>I see a shape in the darkness</line>
        <line>Is it him or is it</line>
        <line>Hes lying down</line>
        <line>Oh Sonya why is he lying down?</line>
        <line>Im so frightened!</line>

        <line>Andrey will never come</line>
        <line>Or something will happen to me before he does</line>

        <speaker>MARYA D.</speaker>
        <line>Sunday morning!</line>
        <line>Time for church!</line>

        <speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
        <line>I suffer more now than before</line>
        <line>The theater and Anatole</line>
        <line>That man who aroused such terrible feelings</line>
        <line>I dont understand</line>
        <line>Have I broken faith with Andrey?</line>
        <line>Am I guilty?</line>

        <speaker>SONYA</speaker>
        <line>After church, Marya left for Prince Bolkonskys</line>

        <speaker>MARYA D.</speaker>
        <line>The rudeness of that man!</line>
        <line>Ill straighten him out!</line>

        <speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
        <line>That terrible old Prince</line>
        <line>I cant bear to think of it</line>
        <line>Ill shut myself in my room</line>
        <line>And try on new dresses</line>

        <speaker>SONYA</speaker>
        <line>And just after Marya left</line>
        <line>There was a knock at the door</line>
        <line>Natasha had just turned her head to the glass</line>
        <line>When she heard a voice that made her flush</line>
    </lyrics>
