        <line>Oh, this is really beyond anything</line>
        <line>These dresses suit you</line>
        <line>This one, metallic gauze</line>
        <line>Straight from Paris</line>

        <line>You are such a lovely thing</line>
        <line>Oh where have you been?</line>
        <line>Its such a shame to bury pearls in the country</line>
        <line>Charmante, charmante, charming</line>
        <line>Now if you have a dress</line>
        <line>You must wear it out</line>
        <line>How can you live in Moscow and not go nowhere?</line>
        <line>So you love somebody, charming</line>
        <line>But thats no reason to shut yourself in</line>
        <line>Even if youre engaged</line>

        <line>Now a woman with a dress</line>
        <line>Is a frightening and powerful thing</line>
        <line>You are not a child</line>
        <line>When youre draped in scarlet and lace</line>
        <line>Your fianc would want you to have fun</line>
        <line>Rather than be bored to death</line>
        <line>Alliez dans le monde</line>

        <line>What once seemed so terrible</line>
        <line>Now seems simple and natural</line>
        <line>She knows that Im engaged</line>
        <line>And still she talks so frankly</line>
        <line>So it must be all right!</line>

        <speaker>HLNE</speaker>
        <line>There is a ball at my house tonight</line>
        <line>You must come</line>
        <line>Oh your wide-open, wondering eyes!</line>
        <line>You will be the prettiest there!</line>
        <line>How the thought of throwing them together amuses me!</line>
        <line>You must come</line>
