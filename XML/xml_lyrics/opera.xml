        <line>Brilliant uniforms</line>
        <line>Pearls and silk</line>
        <line>Glittering before our eyes</line>
        <line>Feminine envy</line>
        <line>A whole crowd of memories</line>
        <line>Desires and emotions</line>
        <line>Natasha, smooth your gown</line>
        <speaker>Chorus</speaker>
        <line>Natasha, smooth your gown</line>

        <speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
        <line>Looking in the glass</line>
        <line>I see I am pretty</line>
        <line>Not a girl anymore</line>
        <line>Ive never felt like this before</line>

        <line>Hundreds of eyes</line>
        <line>Looking at my bare arms</line>
        <line>My bare arms and neck</line>
        <line>My bare arms and shoulders</line>

        <speaker>Chorus</speaker>
        <line>The two remarkably pretty girls</line>
        <line>Had not been seen in Moscow in many years</line>
        <line>Everybody knew vaguely of Natashas engagement</line>
        <line>One of the finest matches in all of Russia</line>

        <speaker>SONYA</speaker>
        <line>Look, theres Alexey, home from the war at last</line>

        <speaker>MARYA D.</speaker>
        <line>He has changed</line>

        <speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
        <line>They are looking at me</line>
        <line>They are talking about me!</line>
        <line>They all like me so much</line>
        <line>The women envious</line>
        <line>The men calming their jealousy</line>

        <speaker>SERVANT</speaker>
        <line>Announcing Fedya Dolokhov</line>
        <line>He dominates Moscows most brilliant young men</line>
        <line>He stands in full view</line>
        <line>Well aware hes attracting attention</line>
        <line>Yet as much at ease as though he were in his own room</line>

        <speaker>MARYA D.</speaker>
        <line>Dolokhov was in the Caucasus</line>
        <line>And he killed the Shahs brother!</line>
        <line>Now all the Moscow ladies are mad about him</line>
        <line>Dolokhov the assassin!</line>
        <speaker>SERVANT</speaker>
        <line>Announcing Countess Hlne Bezukhova</line>
        <line>The queen of society</line>
        <line>Beautiful, barely clothed</line>
        <line>Plump bare shoulders, and much-exposed neck</line>
        <line>Round which she wears a double string of pearls</line>

        <speaker>Chorus</speaker>
        <line>Hlne and Dolokhov, arm in arm</line>
        <line>Pierre the cuckold sits at home</line>
        <line>Pierre the cuckold sits at home</line>
        <line>The poor man</line>

        <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
        <line>No, I am enjoying myself at home this evening</line>

        <speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
        <line>Oh, that neck</line>
        <line>Oh, those pearls</line>

        <speaker>HLNE</speaker>
        <line>So beautiful</line>
        <line>What a charming young girl</line>
        <line>So enchanting</line>

        <speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
        <line>I blush scarlet</line>

        <speaker>MARYA D.</speaker>
        <line>Countess Bezukhova, Pierres wife</line>
        <line>Have you been here long?</line>
        <line>And where is dear Pierre?</line>
        <line>He never used to forget us</line>

        <speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
        <line>Yes Pierre, that good man</line>
        <line>A little sad, a little stout</line>
        <line>He must come visit us</line>

        <speaker>HLNE</speaker>
        <line>I will implore him to do so</line>

        <speaker>MARYA D.</speaker>
        <line>Theres a woman one should stay far away from</line>

        <line>Now Natasha</line>
        <line>The curtain rises</line>

        <speaker>Chorus</speaker>
        <line>The curtain rises</line>

        <speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
        <line>Everyone in the boxes and the stalls became silent</line>
        <line>All the men, old and young, in uniform and evening dress</line>
        <line>All the women in the hall</line>
        <line>With gems on their bare flesh</line>
        <line>Turned their whole attention</line>
        <line>With curiosity to the stage</line>

        <direction>Two singers perform a scene from an avant-garde opera</direction>
        <direction>It is grotesque and amazing</direction>

        <speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
        <line>Grotesque and amazing</line>
        <line>I cannot follow the opera</line>
        <line>Or even listen to the music</line>
        <line>I see painted cardboard</line>

        <line>Queerly dressed actors</line>
        <line>Moving and singing so strangely in the lights</line>
        <line>So false and unnatural</line>
        <line>Im ashamed and amused</line>
        <line>And everyone else seems oblivious</line>
        <line>Yes everyone feigns delight</line>

        <speaker>SONYA</speaker>
        <line>And feeling the flood of brilliant lights</line>
        <line>The warm perfumed air heated by the crowd</line>
        <line>Natasha little by little</line>
        <line>Began to pass into a state of intoxication</line>

        <speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
        <line>Oh Id tickle you all if I could</line>
        <line>Oh Id tickle you all if I could</line>

        <speaker>SONYA</speaker>
        <line>And then</line>
        <line>A rush of cold air</line>

        <speaker>NATASHA &amp; SONYA</speaker>
        <line>An exceptionally handsome man walked in</line>
        <line>With a confident yet courteous air</line>

        <speaker>HLNE</speaker>
        <line>This was Hlnes brother</line>
        <line>Anatole Kuragin</line>
        <line>He moved with a swagger</line>
        <line>Which would have been ridiculous</line>
        <line>Had he not been so good-looking</line>
        <line>And though it was the middle of the act</line>
        <line>He walked right down the aisle</line>
        <line>His sword and spurs jangling</line>
        <line>His handsome perfumed head held high</line>
        <line>And he looked right at Natasha</line>

        <speaker>ANATOLE</speaker>
        <line>Mais charmante</line>

        <speaker>HLNE</speaker>
        <line>And he took his place in the front row next to Dolokhov</line>

        <speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
        <line>How handsome he is</line>
        <line>How intoxicating</line>

        <speaker>SONYA</speaker>
        <line>In the second act there were tombstones</line>
        <line>The moon over the footlights</line>
        <line>Horns and contrabass</line>
        <line>Black cloaks and daggers in their hands</line>

        <speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
        <line>I turn around again and our eyes meet</line>
        <line>He gazes straight into my eyes</line>
        <line>He is talking about me</line>

        <speaker>SONYA</speaker>
        <line>Candles burning</line>
        <line>A crimson throne</line>
        <line>The Tsar wails a mournful tune</line>
        <line>They all wave their arms</line>
        <line>And everybody cheers</line>
        <line>Bravo, bravo!</line>

        <speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
        <line>Every time I look at him</line>
        <line>Hes looking at me</line>
        <line>Every time I look at him</line>
        <line>He's looking at me</line>
        <line>Every time I look at him</line>

        <speaker>SONYA</speaker>
        <line>A terrible noise, a clatter in the crowd</line>
        <line>A storm of chromatic scales and diminished sevenths</line>
        <line>With rapturous faces everyone was shouting</line>
        <line>Screaming and shouting, Bravo!</line>

        <speaker>Chorus</speaker>
        <line>Bravo, bravo</line>
        <line>Bravo, bravo</line>
        <line>Bravo, bravo</line>

        <speaker>SONYA</speaker>
        <line>And then</line>
        <line>A rush of cold air</line>
        <line>And Anatole entered the box</line>
