        <speaker>ALL</speaker>
        <line>Drink with me, my love</line>
        <line>For there's fire in the sky</line>
        <line>And there's ice on the ground</line>
        <line>Either way, my soul will die</line>

        <line>Whoa...</line>

        <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
        <line>The doctors warned me</line>
        <line>That with my corpulence</line>

        <speaker>ALL</speaker>
        <line>Corpulence!</line>

        <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
        <line>Vodka and wine are dangerous for me</line>
        <line>But I drink a great deal</line>
        <line>Only quite at ease</line>
        <line>After pouring several glasses mechanically</line>
        <line>Into my large mouth</line>
        <speaker>PIERRE &amp; ALL</speaker>
        <line>Then I feel</line>
        <line>A pleasant warmth in my body</line>
        <line>A sentimental attachment to my fellow man</line>

        <speaker>HLNE</speaker>
        <line>Keep drinking old man</line>

        <speaker>ANATOLE &amp; DOLOKHOV</speaker>
        <line>Keep drinking old man</line>

        <speaker>ANATOLE</speaker>
        <line>Natasha, Natasha</line>
        <line>Her arms, her shoulders, her neck, her feet</line>

        <speaker>HLNE</speaker>
        <line>The air of a connoisseur</line>

        <speaker>ANATOLE</speaker>
        <line>I will make love to her</line>

        <speaker>DOLOKHOV</speaker>
        <line>Better not, monsieur</line>
        <line>She's first rate, but nothing but trouble</line>

        <speaker>DOLOKHOV &amp; HLNE</speaker>
        <line>Better wait till she's married</line>

        <speaker>DOLOKHOV</speaker>
        <line>Anatole is a married man</line>
        <line>A fact known only to his intimates</line>
        <line>A Polish landowner of some small means</line>
        <line>Had forced him to marry his daughter</line>

        <speaker>ANATOLE</speaker>
        <line>Nevermind about that now</line>
        <line>It doesn't matter</line>
        <line>I don't give a damn</line>
        <line>Just as a duck is made to swim in water</line>
        <line>God has made me as I am</line>
        <line>All I care for is gaiety and women</line>
        <line>And there's no dishonor in that</line>
        <line>As long as there's money and vodka</line>
        <line>I'll keep a feather in my hat</line>

        <speaker>ALL</speaker>
        <line>Whoa...</line>

        <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
        <line>I used to love</line>
        <line>I used to love</line>
        <line>I used to be better</line>

        <speaker>ALL</speaker>
        <line>Keep drinking old man</line>

        <speaker>HLNE</speaker>
        <line>Drink, drink, drink</line>
        <line>God to think I married a man like you</line>

        <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
        <line>Don't speak to me, wife</line>
        <line>There is something inside me...</line>

        <speaker>HLNE</speaker>
        <line>Dolokhov, pour me another</line>

        <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
        <line>Something terrible and monstrous</line>

        <speaker>DOLOKHOV</speaker>
        <line>Here's to the health of married women</line>
        <line>And a smile lurks at the corner of my mouth</line>
        <line>Here's to the health of married women</line>
        <line>And their lovers!</line>
