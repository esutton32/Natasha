        <speaker>BOLKONSKY</speaker>
        <line>Ive aged</line>
        <line>Ive aged so very much</line>
        <line>I fall asleep at the table</line>
        <line>My napkin drops to the floor</line>

        <line>Im full of childish vanities</line>
        <line>I forget things</line>
        <line>And I live in the past</line>
        <line>Ive aged so very much</line>
        <line>People enjoy me though</line>
        <line>I come in for tea in my old-fashioned coat and powdered wig</line>
        <line>And I tell stories</line>
        <line>And utter scathing critiques</line>
        <line>This stern, shrewd old man</line>
        <line>A relic of the past century</line>
        <line>With his gentle daughter</line>
        <line>Such a majestic and agreeable spectacle</line>

        <speaker>MARY</speaker>
        <line>But besides the couple of hours during which we have guests</line>
        <line>There are also twenty-two hours in the day</line>
        <line>During which the private and intimate life of the house continues</line>

        <speaker>BOLKONSKY</speaker>
        <line>Bring my me slippers</line>

        <speaker>MARY</speaker>
        <line>Yes father, yes father</line>

        <speaker>BOLKONSKY</speaker>
        <line>Bring me my wine</line>

        <speaker>MARY</speaker>
        <line>Yes father, yes father</line>

        <speaker>BOLKONSKY</speaker>
        <line>If youre not too busy</line>
        <line>Fiddling with your incense and icons?</line>

        <speaker>MARY</speaker>
        <line>No father, no father</line>
        <line>And I have no friends</line>
        <line>No, never go anywhere</line>
        <line>Never invited</line>
        <line>For who would take care of him</line>

        <speaker>BOLKONSKY</speaker>
        <line>I can hurt you</line>

        <speaker>MARY &amp; BOLKONSKY</speaker>
        <line>I can hurt you</line>

        <speaker>MARY</speaker>
        <line>But I never ever ever ever would</line>
        <line>No father</line>
        <line>I love you father</line>

        <line>And time moves on</line>
        <line>And my fate slips past</line>
        <line>And nothing ever happens to me</line>
        <line>And Countess Natalya Rostova is coming for tea</line>
        <speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
        <line>I know theyll like me</line>
        <line>Everyone has always liked me</line>

        <speaker>BOLKONSKY</speaker>
        <line>Natasha is young</line>
        <line>And worthless and dumb</line>

        <speaker>MARY</speaker>
        <line>And time moves on</line>
        <line>And my fate slips past</line>
        <line>Is this all Ill make of my life?</line>
        <line>Will I never be happy?</line>
        <line>Will I never be anyones wife?</line>

        <speaker>BOLKONSKY</speaker>
        <line>Ah, whats this? A young suitor?</line>
        <line>Ah, come in, come in</line>
        <line>But dont sit down, dont sit down</line>
        <line>Im cold to you</line>
        <line>Yes Im mean to you</line>

        <line>Now be gone, be gone be gone!</line>

        <line>Come in my dear, come in</line>

        <speaker>MARY</speaker>
        <line>And he draws her to him</line>
        <line>And he kisses her hand</line>
        <line>Embraces her affectionately</line>
        <line>And I flush and run out of the room</line>

        <speaker>BOLKONSKY</speaker>
        <line>Come back here</line>
        <line>Let an old man have his fun</line>

        <speaker>MARY</speaker>
        <line>But shes just using you papa</line>
        <line>Wants your money papa!</line>
        <line>To take advantage of your weakness like that</line>
        <line>Its disgusting</line>
        <line>My voice breaks</line>

        <speaker>BOLKONSKY</speaker>
        <line>Its my money and Ill throw it where I want</line>
        <line>Not at you!</line>
        <line>And not at Andreys harlot!</line>

        <line>Insolent girl!</line>
        <line>Insolent girl!</line>
        <line>Where</line>
        <line>Where</line>

        <line>Where are my glasses?</line>
        <line>Where are they?</line>
        <line>Where are my glasses?</line>

        <line>Oh God</line>
        <line>Oh God Im frightened</line>
        <line>Oh God Ive aged so very much</line>

        <line>Where are my glasses?</line>
        <line>Where are my glasses?</line>

        <speaker>MARY</speaker>
        <line>They are there upon his head</line>
        <line>The pride of sacrifice</line>
        <line>Gathers in my soul</line>

        <line>And he forgets things</line>
        <line>He falls asleep at the table</line>
        <line>His napkin drops to the floor</line>
        <line>His shaking head</line>
        <line>Sinks over his plate</line>

        <line>He is old and feeble</line>
        <line>And I dare to judge him</line>
        <line>I disgust myself</line>
        <line>I disgust myself</line>
