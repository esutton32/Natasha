<line>Waiting at the door</line>
<line>Waiting at the door, waiting</line>
<line>Waiting at the door</line>
<line>Waiting at the door, waiting</line>

<line>Oh, how I adore little girls</line>
<line>They lose their heads at once!</line>

<direction>The ball begins; they dance.</direction>
<speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
<line>I am seized by feelings of vanity and fear</line>
<line>There is no barrier between us</line>
<line>Whispers and moans, and ringing in my ear</line>
<line>There is no barrier between us</line>

<line>Divine, delicious, but I do not see or hear anything</line>
<line>I'm borne away to a senseless world</line>
<line>So strange, so remote</line>
<line>I don't know good from bad</line>
<line>Anatole</line>
<line>Anatole</line>
<line>I'm so frightened</line>

<speaker>ANATOLE</speaker>
<line>You are enchanting</line>

<speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
<line>And as we danced</line>
<line>He pressed my waist and hand</line>
<line>And told me I was</line>

<speaker>NATASHA &amp; ANATOLE</speaker>
<line>Bewitching</line>

<speaker>ANATOLE</speaker>
<line>And I love you</line>

<speaker>NATASHA &amp; ANATOLE</speaker>
<line>Bewitching</line>

<speaker>ANATOLE</speaker>
<line>And I love you</line>

<line>NATASHA</line>
<line>And during the ecossaise, he</line>

<speaker>NATASHA (&amp; ANATOLE)</speaker>
<line>Gazed/(Gaze) in my eyes</line>

<line>NATASHA</line>
<line>And said nothing, just</line>

<speaker>NATASHA (&amp; ANATOLE)</speaker>
<line>Gazed/(Gaze) in my eyes</line>

<speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
<line>My frightened eyes</line>

<line>Such confident tenderness</line>
<line>I could not say what I had to say</line>

<speaker>ANATOLE</speaker>
<line>Don't lower your eyes</line>
<line>I love you</line>
<line>I am in love, dear</line>
<line>I am in love</line>
<line>Gaze in my eyes</line>
<line>I love you</line>
<line>You are bewitching</line>
<line>What can I do</line>
<line>Darling, what can I do?</line>

<speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
<line>Don't say such things</line>
<line>I am betrothed</line>
<line>I love another</line>

<speaker>ANATOLE</speaker>
<line>Don't speak to me of that!</line>
<line>When I tell you that I am madly, madly in love with you!</line>
<line>Is it my fault that you're enchanting?</line>

<speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
<line>I'm so frightened</line>
<line>I don't understand anything tonight</line>

<speaker>ANATOLE</speaker>
<line>I'm here now</line>

<direction>Natasha breaks away.</direction>

<speaker>ANATOLE</speaker>
<line>Natalie!</line>

<speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
<line>I can feel your eyes upon me</line>

<speaker>ANATOLE</speaker>
<line>Blocking her path, I bring here face close to mine</line>

<speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
<line>His large, glittering, masculine eyes are so close to mine</line>
<line>That I see nothing else</line>

<speaker>ANATOLE</speaker>
<line>Is it possible that I should never see you again?</line>
<line>I love you madly!</line>
<line>Can I never?</line>
<line>Natalie?</line>

<speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
<line>You press my arm</line>

<speaker>ANATOLE</speaker>
<line>Natalie?</line>

<speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
<line>You're hurting my hands!</line>

<speaker>ANATOLE</speaker>
<line>Natalie?</line>

<speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
<line>I don't understand</line>
<line>I have nothing to say</line>

<direction>They kiss.</direction>

<speaker>NATASHA</speaker>
<line>Burning lips pressed to mine</line>
<line>Tell me what just happened</line>
<line>I'm trembling</line>
<line>So frightening</line>

<line>Andrey</line>

<line>But I love you</line>
<line>Of that there is no doubt</line>
<line>How else could all of this have happened?</line>
<line>How else could we have kissed?</line>
<line>It means that I have loved you from the first</line>
<line>It means that you are kind</line>
<line>Noble and splendid</line>
<line>And I could not help loving you</line>

<line>I will love you, Anatole</line>
<line>I'll do anything for you</line>

<speaker>NATASHA &amp; ANATOLE</speaker>
<line>I'll do anything for you</line></lyrics></ball>
