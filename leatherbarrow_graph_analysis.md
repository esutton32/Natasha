# Graph Analysis

Using the completed markup of both War and Peace and "Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812", we were able to further our comparative research of the novel (book eight, specifically) and the musical. This graph represents the percentage of character references (excluding pronouns) in both works. As far as can be presumed by the data collected, both the novel and the musical put similar emphasis on the main characters in each story. This research assists the theory that book eight of War and Peace and "The Great Comet of 1812" follows a similar plot. 

The most glaring observation made from this graph, is that the characters, Natasha, Pierre, and Anatole are the most referenced throughout the novel and the musical. Their prevalence in both works shows they follow similar character dynamics and plots. Interestingly enough, Pierre, though one of the most prevalent characters, takes a more of a backseat in the musical. He is referenced significantly less than Anatole in the musical, though they share almost the same amount of references in the novel. 

Similarly to Pierre, other minor characters also take more of a backseat in the musical. These characters include: Hélène, Dolokhov, Mary, and Marya D. This is likely due to the need for simplcity for a stage production. Too many characters vying for main character slots creates a convoluted plot. While this works within a novel and each character can be given as much or little detail as the author wishes, a stage production has a rigid window of time to capture the story/adaptation. Also, if a show wants to sell, it needs to be understandable and fathomable to its audience. The literal novel as a smash hit, new musical would likely not be probable. 

One more item of note on this chart is the significant incline in activity from Balaga in the musical. Unlike other minor character, Balaga was given a bigger part in the musical--likely to break tension and work as comedic relief as can be heard in the lyrics "Balaga's just for fun!". Again, because this is an adaptive piece and not simply a retelling of the novel, the stage production has more liberty with the characters and their stories. 

LIMITATIONS: We do acknowledge that there are limitations to our findings. First, since we did not include pronouns in the conduction of our markup in either the book or the musical, this cannot lead to a 100% accurate display of the data. Second, this data does not display characters that might have been in a scene or spoken to directly without the mention of their name. Instances of this occur in the book and the musical, but based on the markup we conducted, we would have no way of knowing when this could take place.
