# Natasha

At present, the goals for this project are as follows:
1. Compare *War and Peace* and its musical adaptation, *Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812* in order to see just how much of the lyrics of the musical are drawn directly from the text with little to no change. (This can be changed later, I just didn't want the readme to be barebones)
