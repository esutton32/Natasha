# Adapting War and Peace: A Lyrical/Musical Analysis of Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812 ☄️

Our project aims to analyze the lyrics and music of Dave Malloy's musical *Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812* in conjunction with the text it is based off of, Tolstoy's *War and Peace*, in order to see how similar the adaptation is to the original. 
Research goals include:
1. Finding tonal shifts in music, and how it correlates in the lyrics
2. Analyzing the lyrics in comparison to the original text to see exactly what is similar
3. Seeing how often each character speaks, and in what form
4. Creating the most beautiful website ever to put our corpus, analysis, and findings in
