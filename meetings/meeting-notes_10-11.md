# Meeting 10-11

## Accomplished 
* We're online!

## Mikey 
* Has a method for converting the score into XML (musescore)
* Roommate is great at singing, will likely join original recording 
* Will continue the process of converting the score into XML
* **Midterm task:** Get one of the songs on the Git repo (probably the prologue). Or, backup: finish a wireframe for the project site. 
* Implementing Wiki style (wireframe?)

## Maddie
* Working with the characters, getting used to Russian naming conventions
* Is there a way to find all of the character 
* Could use a regex pattern to find variations on character names?
* Make a table with the character names (similar to C&P naming table)
* The table will later be styled with CSS to look like a standard Wiki page
* Add an anglicized/francophone name category
* **Midterm task**: Go through Book 8, find instances of names and tag them. Adjust the character directory accordingly. The prologue of the musical will help which names to isolate (and add character descriptions from the prologue to the character table). 

## Ella
* Encoding of special characters is presenting issues
* Needs to standardize method of tagging, as well as add metadata to the lyrics 
* Would like to tag instances where people describe themselves or someone else doing something
* **Midterm task**: Standardize tagging, write a schema for the lyrics, finish marking up the lyrics (with instances of names, if possible).
