- Ella did simple markup of the first act; will do more

**What We Did in This Meeting**
- Ella pushed subdirectory XML with subdirectory xml_lyrics

**To-Do**
- Ella keep marking up lyrics XML; goal to have all of it finished w/metadata and everything

- Assuming that Mikey has a working computer, she will have the Prologue marked up and will have worked with Ella to see if there is any way to combine lyrical and musical markup
- Maddie will work on interconnections between characters and noting diminuitives, other names
- Mikey will look at CSS for My Immortal project to see if imitation is viable
